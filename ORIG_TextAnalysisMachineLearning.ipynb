              "['Pinterest David Bowie ’s first greatest-hits set was called Changesonebowie , and the title has proven irresistible to his compilers: That collection was followed by 1981’s Changestwobowie, 1990’s Changesbowie, and 1997’s radio special ChangesNowBowie.Interspersing clips of a long interview with Mary Anne Hobbs with exclusive performances recorded during November 1996 rehearsals for his 50th-birthday concert at Madison Square Garden, ChangesNowBowie originally aired on BBC Radio 1 the week of Bowie’s birthday.Bowie was feeling valedictory at the time, a mood that came through in both the musing interviews and the laid-back performances, backed only by guitarist Reeves Gabrels, bassist/vocalist Gail Ann Dorsey, and keyboardist Mark Plati.The Hobbs-hosted show circulated intact on bootlegs for years, and the official LP was initially slated as a Record Store Day 2020 exclusive.Thanks to COVID-19, the physical release was pushed back, but the digital version is here, and the sanctioned release differs from the fans-only versions in substantial ways.All the interview segments with Hobbes have been excised, as have the birthday wishes from his peers and acolytes, leaving a tight 32 minutes of music—nine songs that appear in a different order than they did in the broadcast.In strict terms of listenability, all the edits are logical.Radio requires a different rhythm than an album, and the BBC Radio 1 broadcast sometimes bogged down in discussions, albeit many of them fascinating.The show hit its emotional peak with a greeting from Scott Walker , who thanked Bowie “for your generosity in spirit when it comes to other artists.I’ve been the beneficiary on more than one occasion, let me tell you,” a sentiment that left Bowie speechless and teary.It was the one time he let his guard slip in the interview.Throughout the rest of the broadcast, he was garrulous and charming, sounding utterly comfortable embracing his role as an elder statesman of rock.The live performances have a similar spirit, sounding so relaxed they’re almost cozy.Tellingly, Bowie’s setlist avoids songs from both the dark, roiling Brian Eno reunion 1.Outside and the drum’n’bass-besotted Earthling, which would appear a month after his 50th birthday.These two records found Bowie wrestling with contemporary music, but apart from a version of “The Man Who Sold the World”—a nod to Nirvana popularizing the song a few years earlier on their MTV Unplugged —the modern world barely can be discerned on ChangesNowBowie.Although Bowie conspicuously avoids the big hits, the songs are largely drawn from the early 1970s—even the Velvet Underground’s “White Light/White Heat,” heard here in a stomping version, was a staple in concerts by the Spiders From Mars—leaving just the Lodger deep cut “Repetition” and Tin Machine song “Shopping for Girls” as the album’s surprises.Next to warhorses like “Lady Stardust,” “Aladdin Sane,” and “Andy Warhol,” these are comparative novelties and they catch the ear: “Repetition” receives a lanky acoustic rearrangement, and without the heavy thump of the Hunt Brothers, “Shopping for Girls” turns sprightly and lithe.Save these two selections and the VU cover, ChangesNowBowie is built for comfort, not speed.Bowie understood that the audience for this BBC Radio 1 show was upscale and settled, perhaps nurturing a slight nostalgic bent, and he adjusted his performance accordingly, giving the people something close to what they want: old tunes—but not oldies—performed with skill and a burnished grace.Looking back, the live-in-the-studio set seems slightly out of step with Bowie’s adventurous 1990s, feeling more of a piece with the rock classicism he’d play at the dawn of the 2000s.It also feels slight.Unlike other Bowie live albums, this doesn’t document a specific tour or phase.It’s just a quiet, pleasant footnote to a busy era.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Flat Worms don’t lack talent.Frontman Will Ivy is flanked by drummer Justin Sullivan ( Kevin Morby , The Babies ) and bassist Tim Hellman, who’s played with Ty Segall and Oh Sees .In late 2017, the Los Angeles garage rockers’ kinetic and scrappy self-titled debut delivered a fuzzed-out blitz with no real agenda.Three years on, they’ve upgraded their sound: Steve Albini and Segall co-man the desk at Electrical Audio, where the trio recorded their second album.The setup may be a rock nerd’s dream, but the cleaned-up sound doesn’t do them any favors; Antarctica is a dour proposal for a societal reset that winds up feeling distracted by hero worship.Opener and lead single “The Aughts” makes for a promising start, melding the sneering spectre of latter-day Fall with Ivy’s pointed decrees.It’s a promise the album struggles to keep.Though Albini’s style suits the pummeling “Plastic Casts,” the shift from scorched earworms to taut, cookie-cutter post-punk becomes distracting.It’s one thing to ape a classic Albini recording like Shellac ’s “ Steady as She Goes ” with an obvious homage like “Wet Concrete,” but on Albini’s own watch?He’d be within his rights to seek a secondary credit.Thematically, Antarctica suggests a through-line between the chaos of modern society and the titular desolate continent.But many of these songs fumble the intent quite badly.“Market Forces” takes questionable aim at the state and mass media: “Personality cult chambers/Showcase the peacock feathers.” “Stick to the formula, turn out another/Four on the floor, the greatest night ever,” goes “Ripper One,” an admission of mediocrity as much as anything else.While Flat Worms’ punk heroes—like Mark E. Smith, or Nikki Sudden of Swell Maps —could wield ambiguity like a scythe, here empty words take center stage.Warbly, woozed-out guitar forays help to blunt the lack of conviction.The seasick lead phrases on mid-album peak “Via” and the forcefield of feedback at the tail end of “The Aughts” ease the absence of the full-blown fuzz that made Flat Worms such a heady trip.The hand of Segall—who recorded the band’s The Apparition/Melt The Arms 7\" and last year’s Into the Iris EP, and releases Antarctica via his Drag City imprint GOD?Records—surely plays a part in bringing these silver linings to light.But to stand out in a supersaturated garage scene, Ivy and co. must command focus.The pencil-drawn analogy between Antarctica and the here-and-now isn’t exactly a reach, but the album’s perspective is blurry at best.Though Antarctica positions itself as an assessment of worldly chaos and isolation, it’s never clear whether the stance is earnest or apathetic.Even Albini-tier fidelity can’t make this formula sound fresh.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)10 to Hear Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week Sign Up Now',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Skylar Gudasz ’s 2016 debut, Oleander , was North Carolina’s best-kept secret.Her follow-up, Cinema, is already attracting national attention.It’s not hard to see why this might be Gudasz’s moment: She’s a gifted singer-songwriter with a voice that attracts metaphors about hypnotism, and she’s wound her rhythm section like a swinging silver watch.Cinema is as dark and groovy as Oleander was bright and wafting; it’s more imperative and solidly formed.It also adds enough breadth to her discography to glimpse, beyond the individual beautiful songs, the outline of a holistic artistic persona, distinguished by Gudasz’s subtle, complex staging of femininity.Cinema’s multitude of genres are all tuned to the storm-cloud key of majestic opener “Femme Fatale.” “Rider” is country, “Animal” is folk, “Actress” is garage-psych, and “Go Away” is piano pop, but the album’s well-developed throughlines make the variation discreet.Gudasz’s band of North Carolina ringers sail at a measured pace, just like how she sings, and the scratchy snarl of her guitar keeps the organs and strings down to earth.The fountaining run of her voice recalls Joni Mitchell , while her classic yet chameleonic songwriting suggests Leonard Cohen , another student of ambiguity with the nerve to put his own name in a song, as Gudasz does on “Animal.” But her developing conceptual persona adds something new to the mix: the enigmatic self-performance of someone like Lana Del Rey .Individually, the songs impress with the poetry and grace of their sensory details, like the “waist inside the crook of my arm” from the back of a motorcycle on “Rider.” Cumulatively, they bring the razor-edged meaning of certain recurring traits into sharp focus.That “Rider” verse proceeds with such delicacy that it’s easy to miss the bloody crash at the end, and it’s indicative of the way Gudasz ironizes images of love without cheapening them.Her songs almost invariably contain an “I” and a “you,” though Gudasz might be either, neither, or both.She addresses women characters with tenderness, and men with amused contempt veiled by sweetness.(Any time you hear her call someone “babe,” watch out.)She slips, blank-faced, into masculine pronouns, a device that runs from Oleander’s “I’ll Be Your Man” to her stunning recent cover of “ Wichita Lineman .” Iconic images of feminine glamour—in press photos, she reclines on the hood of a classic car or stands on a dune wearing fur—are Trojan horses for songs that undermine them from within, as Gudasz deconstructs male projections through pantomime and denunciation.“I ain’t no silent doll, and I ain’t that sweet,” she warns on “Play Nice,” lest anyone is having trouble telling the sugar from the salt.Cinema revolves around two archetypes: the star and the server, the one who is only seen and the one who never is.The former is writ large in the album’s title and film-noir tint, the latter in “Waitress” and the video for “Rider.” The two characters blur together in “Actress,” the purest expression of Gudasz’s resistance to resolving multiple exposures into one pat image.The overlapping, shifting edges between personal and projected desire are the contested zone she’s exploring.Instead of evading projections such as bad girl, sweet girl, tough girl—any kind of girl, really—Gudasz tries them on for size, humanizing them, only to fling back the empty costumes with a potent question for the culture that created them: So, this is what you want?Are you sure?10 to Hear Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week Sign Up Now',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Sir Richard Bishop is one of the most riveting and dynamic acoustic guitarists on the planet, but he’s seldom seemed interested in the tropes of the solo guitar tradition.Since his 1998 debut on Revenant, John Fahey ’s own label and a bastion of stylistic misfits, the Sun City Girls cofounder has indulged a deep restless streak, making records that nod toward his six-string contemporaries before racing off in a dozen directions.In the span of a few tracks, he might conjure the endless ecstasy of Munir Bashir , the cinematic elegance of Chet Atkins , and the spare beauty of Libba Cotten .The title of Polytheistic Fragments , his staggering 2007 Drag City album, still feels like a mission statement: Rather than subscribe to one belief system, Bishop has marshalled a more useful personal theology by borrowing a bit from everything he loves.Given Bishop’s insatiable curiosity, an album like his new Oneiric Formulary was inevitable.On his first solo outing since 2015’s Tangier Sessions , a painstaking exploration of every sound he could wring from a mysteriously salvaged guitar , Bishop doesn’t actually pick up a guitar for nearly half these tracks.Instead, he chops samples into spooky sequences as though he were RZA ’s wayward understudy for “Call to Order” and surrenders himself to a nearly nine-minute morass of maligned circuits like a half-asleep Yellow Swans for “Graveyard Wanderers.” Yes, Bishop takes the guitar on a few mesmerizing turns, alternately embracing frenetic strums and pleasant licks familiar from his past.But on an album inspired by the sounds and scenes of his dreams, Bishop finally seems tired of being confined to one instrument.Of course, realizing Bishop isn’t here just to play guitar (or even piano, where his dizzying notes recall the puffy, cloudlike shapes of La Monte Young’s music) brings an initial twinge of disappointment.Imagine the letdown of going to see Michael Jordan man the outfield or paying handsomely to hear a member of Led Zeppelin plunge into microtonal improvisation .But even without the guitar, Bishop communicates his endearing sentimentality and his boundless instrumental ambitions.The dizzying pace and radiant tones of “Dust Devils”—a game approximation of frame drum and the strident Arabic mizmar, played with a MIDI keyboard—are as gripping as his most bristling Freak of Araby pieces .And his electronic lute lines for “Renaissance Nod” recall the contemplative pace of Bishop’s piano works : Same moods, different deliveries.Still, when Bishop grabs the guitar, you remember what you were missing.During the “The Coming of the Rats,” he thumbs out a staccato acoustic strut while fluorescent electric drones pirouette in slow-motion.It’s eerie and gorgeous, like Robert Fripp scoring some dimly lit alley scene in a gangster movie.And on “Celerity,” Bishop’s heavy strums are so fast, angular, and agile it sounds like Aphex Twin sampled him and built the track one meter at a time.Bishop somehow fits notes inside of rests that don’t seem to exist—the effect is exhilarating, like a motivational speech crammed into four breathless minutes.Bishop seems to understand it’s still reassuring to hear his particular sort of guitar mastery, where the emotions run as deep and free as the peerless technique.To wit, he ends the mid-album triptych of songs without guitar with “Enville,” a piece so brisk and resplendent it would be the standout on almost any record by the latest generation of solo acoustic guitarists.Aside from the introduction, it’s the shortest track here, so you might overlook it between the clangor of “Dust Devils” and the speed of “Black Sara.” But listen again to how cleanly Bishop plays and how many images he’s able to evoke in about two minutes.In one moment, I picture a tree-lined pasture, birdsong dancing at the edge of the field; in another, the quiet bliss of crossing a tedious item off a too-old to-do list.Hearing “Enville,” you get why Bishop might want to write beyond the guitar now—how can one instrument get more exquisite or evocative than this?Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Fear of Music, the third album by Talking Heads , begins at maximum velocity and minimum warmth.Congas, funk guitar, chirping synths: Everything is in motion, and yet curiously, nothing seems to be moving.A guitar figure like a crying baby keeps tripping the song’s downbeat, and in the closing seconds, a phased guitar line comes in played by Robert Fripp , layering 5/4 over 4/4 and effectively erasing whatever forward momentum this blank, pistoning thing was creating to begin with.The groove feels uncanny, a little inhuman, like a flag rippling in no wind.The words, meanwhile, consist of barked nonsense syllables from Hugo Ball, a German poet of the Dada School.Dadaism mocked the very idea that words could convey meaning, that speakers could carry authority; for a band so devoted to verbal communication they named themselves after it, it was a forbidding gesture.And for fans of the New York band in the late ’70s, hearing “I Zimbra” might have felt like watching their hero obliterated in the first frame of the movie.It was exactly this sort of hero’s-journey narrative into which Fear of Music seemed to cast a wrench.The band’s popularity and acclaim had been gathering heat; “Take Me to the River,” their stiff-legged cover version of the Al Green standard, peaked at No.26 on the Hot 100.They’d appeared on Saturday Night Live and American Bandstand , and they’d been touring to steadily bigger crowds.Already the quintessential New York band to New Yorkers, now they risked becoming the quintessential New York band to everyone else—maybe even to the sorts of folks who lived in the “ Big Country ,” the places about which Byrne had already admitted, “I wouldn’t live there if you paid me.” Fear of Music can be read, in part, as an attempt to throw buckets of conceptual cold water on everything that had made the Talking Heads beloved, or to at least submit it to rigorous forensic testing.They experimented with their songwriting process; instead of working from Byrne’s compositions, they entered the studio cold, jamming together until the shape of something promising emerged.As they did on More Songs About Buildings and Food, they enlisted Brian Eno as producer, but this time Eno played a much bigger role: It was Eno who suggested a Table of Contents approach to the tracklist, which turned the song titles into a litany of proper nouns, and it was he who furnished the Hugo Ball poem for inspiration when Byrne was struggling with writer’s block.As a band of former design students, the Talking Heads thought harder than most about presentation, about the telling power of surfaces.On Fear of Music, they repeatedly drew attention away from the picture to gesture at the frame: The radio announcement for the album was a simple, stilted intonation—“Talking Heads have a new album/It’s called Fear of Music”—repeated over and over.The album cover was a black obelisk, alternately bumpy and smooth but admitting no light and emitting no clues.There was a song called “Electric Guitar,” and the refrain, as the electric guitars gnashed their teeth in every available space, was “Never listen to electric guitar.” The bittersweet futility of this command neatly encapsulated a band that was a tangle of conflicting impulses in 1979.They shunned every method that had worked for them before, attempting perhaps to become a different version of themselves, and yet they only purified their essence.In jettisoning old methods and throwing themselves into new ones, they embraced the only true underlying force of their music: relentless interrogation.The album plays out like a series of mini-stand up routines about the absurdity, or the pointlessness, of human observation.Each song contains at least one declaration of seeming authority (“Hold on, because it’s been taken care of”; “Find myself a city to live in”), which Byrne goes on to repeat with increasing mania and decreasing confidence.As the music subdivides itself into a million tiny repeating phrases, you feel a grasping mind trying and failing to find purchase.“Everything seems to be up in the air at this time,\" Byrne observed mildly on “Mind,” with deadpan irony.On Fear of Music, he became our metaphysical straight man, able to defamiliarize the world, object by object, with his through-a-telescope gaze and his curious tone.He describes his “Mind” like some peculiar object that has crash-landed in his living room.“Drugs won’t change you/Religion won’t change you/What’s the matter with you?/I haven’t got the faintest idea,” Byrne mutters.Imagine a multi-tentacled alien attempting to put on a pair of pants; this was Byrne trying to make sense of reality.The album is almost heroically funny, each song a fit of pique aimed at the broadest and most pervasive targets imaginable: paper (things never fit on it), electric guitars (you should never listen to it), and air—for god’s sake, air.“Air can hurt you, too,” Byrne reminds us—a hell of a retort to the patronizing suggestion to “get some air.” He agonizes over the existence of “Animals”; “They’re never there when you need them/They’re never there when you call them.” He sounds incensed, deranged, his voice going guttural and squeaky—the performance is a hair’s breadth away from shtick.His voice rises to an indignant peak at the biggest insult: Animals “don’t even know what a joke is.” The music seems to know exactly what a joke is, and there are points where it seems to be laughing directly at you.There’s the “nyah-nyah” keyboard refrain on “I Zimbra,” the chittering keyboard on “Mind” like a bird that won’t shut up outside your window, undermined by Tina Weymouth’s banana-peel bassline.Like any good joke, the music seems to be constantly retelling itself, circling back on the first thought before the second thought even begins.Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, stop me if you’ve heard this, stop me, stop me.It’s the sound of propulsive uncertainty.“Still might be a chance that it might work out,” Byrne squeaks on “Paper,” which is what you say just before everything falls apart.The scratching sound on “Cities” mimic pencils blackening every inch of a paper’s free space, and the keyboards, the vocals, strike with the force of a typewriter hammer smacking paper.This was writing and thinking as a percussive act, each note a small panicked violence on reality, the force and insistence belying the foreknowledge that all this would disappear eventually.Cities would fall to war, the good times would end, were always ending—if Byrne wasn’t going to break his bug-eyed poker face to spell all this out to you, Jerry Harrison’s guitars and keyboards were going to scream it.The guitar that intrudes at the end of “Mind” is like a pained groan, begging Byrne to shut up.The ratcheting sound ringing throughout “Cities” sounds like a scythe trying to sever the talking head from its body, once and for all.At the center of Fear of Music is “Life During Wartime,” inarguably one of their five most iconic songs.The lyrics ratchet paranoia all the way to the top: We open with a van loaded with weapons, rumored but not seen, and a gravesite “where nobody knows.” A triumph consists of finding some peanut butter to last you “a couple of days.” Everything else—records to play, letters to write, identity crises to have (“I’ve changed my hairstyle so many times now…”) is just quaint, a reminder of better times when we were allowed to be miserable for our own little reasons.Significantly, it’s the calmest that Byrne had ever sounded on record to that point—all the quavers in that reedy voice were suddenly smoothed out.The panic is always in the anticipation; when the disaster hits, we’re oddly calm.“The sound of gunfire, off in the distance/I’m getting used to it now.” I’m getting used to it now—is there any proclamation of success bleaker?The song, and Byrne’s vocal performance, offered a premonition of the shellacked hair and hard angles of his big-suit, early-’80s Stop Making Sense era, which would begin in earnest with 1980’s masterpiece Remain in Light .There was an incipient pitilessness to the American air; the country had just elected Reagan.New York City was a pyre of burning tenements and a city teetering on the brink of financial ruin.When chaos descends, talk is the first thing deemed cheap.So Byrne burned his notebooks, as the lyrics went, and all that was left was the burning in his chest that kept him alive.Civilization is a privilege; anxiety is a privilege; worrying about paper and minds and dogs and drugs are privileges, and they might constitute the best and sweetest moments of your life.That’s the joke, that’s both the setup and the punchline: You think you’re miserable now?This misery is the good part.And that would be the epigraph of Fear of Music if it weren’t for “Heaven.” It’s a song that Byrne almost didn’t write, based on a melody he nearly threw away.Eno heard Byrne humming it to himself and drew the song out of him, like a forced confession.The band in heaven plays your favorite song, plays it all night long.It’s a place where nothing ever happens; everyone leaves the party at the same time, and every kiss begins again exactly the same.The song is a prayer for order, a cessation of observation.When the act of observation, which grants us our humanity and fuels our neurosis, falls away—what’s left?Pure experience, untouched by anything else.“There’s a party in my mind, and I hope it never stops,” Byrne says on “Memories Can’t Wait.” Maybe the best moment happens when everyone leaves.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for Talking Heads',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Contrary to the way they sounded, Talking Heads were not in a hurry.David Byrne , Tina Weymouth, and Chris Frantz had no particular plan to play music together when they moved to New York City after the dissolution of Frantz and Byrne’s band back in Providence, where all three had attended the Rhode Island School of Design.That lasted until Frantz and Weymouth saw the Ramones at CBGB shortly after they arrived—the kind of downtown show a couple of broke art-school graduates might wander into in late 1974.Still buzzing, Frantz, the drummer, convinced Byrne, the singer-guitarist, to give it another go.But they didn’t have a bassist in New York, and they couldn’t find one they liked.Rather than settle and start playing shows quickly, they decided that Weymouth could do it—never mind that she’d never touched a bass before.She bought one on layaway and set about learning, listening to records by pioneering hard rocker Suzi Quatro and receiving occasional words of encouragement from free jazz legend Don Cherry , who happened to live in the same building, down the street from CBGB, where the newly minted trio rented a loft for $250 a month.Talking Heads practiced for six months before they were ready for their first gig: at CB’s, in June 1975, opening for the Ramones .Another two years passed before they recorded and released their debut album.They had a big future ahead of them.Why rush?During those two years, they developed their music and career carefully.They added a fourth member in keyboardist-guitarist Jerry Harrison, formerly of the Modern Lovers, to fill out their spindly early sound.They turned down one record deal, always waiting for the right fit.They immersed themselves in the profuse richness of music and art that New York made available at the time: dancing to disco and salsa, rubbing elbows with avant-garde improvisers like Cherry and composers like Philip Glass , jamming with Arthur Russell , who almost got Harrison’s seat in the final lineup.And they brought it all with them as they clawed their way to the center of the new thing called punk rock that was happening at CBGB.Talking Heads 77 feels both like the culmination of the band’s days as downtown New York darlings and the primordial origin of their late-’70s-early-’80s masterpieces.They were already accomplished enough that Rolling Stone opened its review by noting how long they’d taken to record an album, and Talking Heads 77 shows it, expressing an arch, agitated, and abundantly tuneful sensibility belonging entirely to them.If they had gone the way of their less durable CB’s scene peers—say, the Dictators, or the Shirts—and broken up soon after, it might have been viewed as a one-and-done record collector classic today.But they didn’t.Alongside its ingenuity, Talking Heads 77 also exists as a mere glimmer of potential, a fascinating prelude to a few of the most visionary albums ever recorded.The band’s curiously multivalent relationship with pop music was already being negotiated.Across 11 songs, Talking Heads aspire to pop’s communal uplift while also creating distance from the genuine article.A few seconds into “Uh Oh, Love Comes to Town”— cymbal crashes, four chords ascending toward frenzy, the rhythm locking in—and we’ve arrived indisputably at the Talking Heads sound.Frantz plays like an R&B session drummer with a gun held to his head, just a little too edgy and insistent.Weymouth is bouncy and melodic, with no trace of a beginner’s tentativeness.A gleeful steel pan solo appears from nowhere, an early sign of the band’s disinterest in rock orthodoxy.Byrne yelps, proclaims, and carries on conversations with himself.As he would again and again, he addresses human connection in the stilted language of an atomized and impersonal society.He frets that falling in love might cause him to “neglect my duties,” as a stockbroker might make a bad investment—so concerned with performing his role that love becomes an incursion, an obstacle toward getting work done.Crucially, however, “Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town” is not black-witted satire.It may be a postmodern send-up of a love song, but it’s also a love song.The rhythm section does a stiff imitation of the Funk Brothers, but they still lay down a pretty good groove for dancing.Parsing the blend of sincerity and irony in any Talking Heads song is difficult, but you never doubt their belief in the music.For New York, 1977 was a difficult year—economic freefall, neighborhoods ravaged by arson fires, a blackout that threw the city briefly into anarchy, the shadow of a serial killer who stalked the outer boroughs the summer before—and Talking Heads 77 occasionally embodies that darkness.“Psycho Killer,” the catchiest song ever written about a sociopathic murderer, is more disquieting in footage of an early CBGB performance than it is on record, where it evolved into a campy performance of violence, turning the killer’s chilling laughter into a goofy refrain.“No Compassion” is more mundane, and more menacing because of it, with a narrator who calmly rationalizes his own refusal to empathize with anyone.Opening with an uncharacteristically hard-rocking riff and lurching between two drastically different tempos, it feels like a last vestige of affinity with the punk scene’s heavier and more nihilistic tendencies.Still, its message probably shouldn’t be taken at face value.“So many people have their problems/I’m not interested in their problems,” Byrne moans at one point, a rich sentiment coming from a guy beset by problems on all sides and eager to tell you about it, whose response to the joys of new love is a resounding “uh oh.” Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest When the Ramones and Talking Heads toured Europe in the spring of 1977, Johnny Ramone was annoyed by seemingly everything.The varieties of lettuce served abroad.Stonehenge (“a buncha rocks,” he called it, according to the excellent book Love Goes to Buildings on Fire ).And of course, the James Brown tapes that Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth played on the bus.Though the two bands frequently gigged together within the early New York punk scene, the Ramones were all about girl groups and surf rock, while their preppy-looking tourmates—particularly Weymouth and her soon-to-be husband, drummer Chris Frantz—were wild about funky R&B.Toward the end of the tour, Talking Heads played a small solo show in London.Brian Eno , fresh off making Low with David Bowie , caught the gig and invited the band to lunch the next day, which turned into listening to records at his flat.The producer put on Fela Kuti ’s Afrodisiac and blew their minds.Afrobeat music (particularly West African polyrhythms) would become the next big influence on the members of Talking Heads, culminating in their magnum opus, 1980’s Remain in Light .But while that was still percolating, the group made an immediate connection with Eno.By the following spring, Talking Heads had kicked their original production team of disco pros to the curb and took up recording More Songs About Buildings and Food alongside Eno in the Bahamas.Though many tracks on their second album were live staples dating back to 1975, the songs took on a more groove-oriented sound as Talking Heads progressed and played to their strengths.Incorporating disco rhythms separated them further from Television, their closest corollary in the CBGB scene.The tempos were slowed down and simmering, while the layers of instrumentation and effects were built up.You can hear Eno’s “studio as instrument” approach in all sorts of sonic details, like the loudspeaker-style vocals and reverb bouncing off the drums in “Warning Sign,” the curious clicks and dubby echoes punctuating “Stay Hungry,” or the faint twinkling between lines in the chorus of their heady cover of Al Green’s “Take Me to the River.” But these increasingly intricate aesthetics never threaten to overthrow the music’s pleasure center: an involuntary compulsion to move your body.On More Songs About Buildings and Food, Talking Heads were sorting out how to engage simultaneously with the mind and the soul (or at least the hips)—how to be both art-rock and dance music.“Take Me to the River,” their first Top 40 hit, is ground zero for this duality.At the time, various white fools were reinterpreting Reverend Green’s 1974 album-cut -turned- Syl-Johnson-hit , ranging from the horrid (Foghat) to the decent (Levon Helm); none of them come near Talking Heads’ singular take.A soul song that walks the line between the sacred and the profane is not something you’d expect a singer who typically yelped quotidian paranoia to excel at, yet David Byrne’s idiosyncratic vocal phrasings—his pauses, his stretched-out crooning and strained falsetto, his “yayayayayaya” that sounds like it’s coming toward you—forever changed the way people hear “Take Me to the River.” And Byrne isn’t even the cover’s main power source, Weymouth is.Their version is one big, throbbing bass loop—the fastest, possibly only route to a sexy Talking Heads song.Byrne spends much of his band’s most immediately danceable record not getting laid, though.He claims he’s just too busy for romance these days.When he demands, atop a frantic guitar jangle in “The Good Thing,” that you stop and watch him work, it could almost be the album’s thesis statement.But Byrne is not just a workaholic, he’s also humorously jaded: The girls, after all, are “ getting into abstract analysis ” instead of paying attention to him.The one clear relationship portrait he paints is completely absurd, centering around a couple that funnels their stupid fights into a hit TV show; cheekily, it’s called “Found a Job.” By and large, these songs are about being a young, ambitious artist in the city, an album where the age is forever 26 and the mood is raring to go.Two songs that epitomize this outlook, “Artists Only” and “The Big Country,” are among the album’s most beautiful—the former for its interlocking parts, the latter for its swooning simplicity.An ode to the creative process, “Artists Only” is built from the kind of instrumental interplay that makes you want to dismantle it just so you can understand the source of its magic and mystery; is it the swirling organ melody, the chiming guitar riff, or the chugging bassline that produces this effect?(Like most things Talking Heads, the magic’s in the combinations.)Meanwhile, “The Big Country” is as lucid (and twangy) as Byrne gets: “I wouldn’t live there if you paid me,” he pronounces outright in the surprisingly laidback chorus.He borrowed the phrase “the big country” from Roxy Music’s Country Life closer “Prairie Rose,” where it refers to Texas, but as far as Byrne’s concerned, it’s any place you’d fly over without feeling much curiosity.It’s a barbed judgement he sings with relative peace, like someone relieved they live amid the move and hustle of New York City instead of, y’know, America.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest In nearly 35 years of David Byrne ’s stage performances, some elements have endured: He still dances passionately with floor lamps.He lies supine on the stage, singing into his headset.Brass and woodwind players march around him in geometric shapes.Above all, his hyphenate backing singers/dancers always seem positively euphoric, beaming in a way that transcends professionally rehearsed cheer, as they execute song after song of quirky, nimble bends and leaps, the sort of exaggerated movements that evoke children’s specials and turtleneck-heavy performance art.From Talking Heads’ epochal 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense to Byrne’s celebrated 2019 Broadway show American Utopia , these dancers’ amusement has always been scrawled on their faces: How different this is, they seem to muse while in their Gumby contortions, perfectly identical yet each awed in their expressions.What an absurd, wonderful thing we’re doing now.Their balance of joyful freedom inside methodical choreography, spontaneity inside structure, perfectly mirrors Talking Heads, who first mastered that equilibrium in the studio.On their fifth album, Speaking in Tongues, Byrne, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, and Jerry Harrison indulge their unusual, gamboling whims within solid walls.The record brought along the spry, Afrobeat-inspired polyrhythms and funk saunter of 1980’s Remain in Light while adding in new wave’s synths and the sharp, physical precision of Byrne’s 1981 score for Twyla Tharp’s dance piece The Catherine Wheel; there are also glimmers of the neon pop cheer of Weymouth and Frantz’s side project Tom Tom Club .Together, this inky passport of sounds yields an album that, besides smoothly mixing art-rock with funk with pop, feels meticulously mapped for the collective yet informed by the movements of the individuals.Even for an album titled after communication—nodding to both glossolalia and Byrne’s famously garbled scatting in recording sessions—Speaking in Tongues is singularly immediate and direct.In each song, one concept—one saucy bass-and-piano walking line, one ricocheting keyboard line, one heavily shouted pyromaniac refrain—repeats into an insistent foundation, so emphatic it begins to burrow into a trancelike state befitting the album name.Choruses are evolutions of verses, of ideas that have repeated enough to feel lived-in.Weymouth’s funk bass, the unsung star of the album, is never far from the foreground.This rigid framework throughout allows the rest of the instrumentation to cavort above it: A jubilant momentum rises throughout “Girlfriend Is Better,” but its base—a sauntering line from Weymouth, sci-fi synth radiation from guest Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic—is set quickly.This bedrock allows for Byrne’s hoarse, scattered shouting to reach velocity above while still feeling controlled.“Pull Up the Roots” flirts with disco as it rides a tight rhythm section that feels a shade too hectic for dancing; the bass bounce starts at a gallop and the guitar backflips around it.“Burning Down the House,” Speaking in Tongue’s biggest hit—and the only Top 10 single in Talking Heads’ entire catalog—starts with a literal scream from Byrne, and has no clear markers between verse and chorus: It is a full stampede to the howled refrain, an explosion buoyed by such a perky trajectory, it sneakily exculpates some the most insurgently unglued lyrics to ever crack the Billboard charts.(“People on their way to work and baby what did you expect?/Gonna burst into flame!” is some dark, dark weather.)Byrne’s lyrics have been deemed inscrutable art-school fare by many, minimized as Mad Libs sold as gospel; in fact, as Speaking in Tongues proves definitively, they are is the opposite.Byrne sings like a kindergarten teacher, or a Rosetta Stone language bot: in plainspoken, short observations that make sense individually, yet sequence into a mystifying dialogue.On “Moon Rocks,” when Byrne seems to scoff at alien intelligence—“Flying saucers, levitation/Yo I could do that!”—and follows it up a hair’s-breadth later with a liberal arts pep talk—\"So take your hands out of your pockets/And get your face adjusted”—these are perfectly intelligible thoughts, individually.On “Slippery People,” Byrne and sensational guest vocalist Nona Hendryx offer a strange sort of gospel proselytizing—\"Turn like a wheel, he’s alright/See for yourself, the Lord won’t mind,” a millisecond before sharing stark memories of cold bathtub water\\xad—over a merry funk pulse and scratchy, uber-’80s synths.For all its charms, and the big single it housed, Speaking in Tongues lies in the shadow of Remain in Light; it’s not as effortlessly cohesive, its diffused interests not as zealous and enchanting as its more focused predecessor.But Speaking in Tongues does have the distinction of ending on the Talking Heads song most likely to be on a skeptic’s wedding playlist: “This Must Be the Place,” a neurotic’s concession to love even as he frets over the transience of life, and a bittersweet pact to let someone into his fearful mind.Byrne is unusually tender; his wild thoughts flow in one direction.As he sings gently to his partner, wondering, “Did I find you, or you find me?” the beautiful messiness of existence seems to soften.Here aren’t 30 thoughts bandying for space in Byrne’s fulminating brain, only vulnerability.There aren’t three synth lines racing off a cliff, just some percussive clang and one light synth wobble.His expression of love feels even more romantic because he clearly still knows love is a distraction.It\\'s the strangest move of all from him, and it almost makes sense.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Early in their career, Talking Heads seemed to be a manifestation of frontman David Byrne’s physiology: lean, angular, and severe.Journalists loved to point out his resemblance to Psycho’s clean-cut villain Norman Bates , especially when writing about their enduring first hit “ Psycho Killer .” It was far too easy an observation, and one Byrne resented.Having sprouted at Rhode Island School of Design and relocated to New York in the mid-’70s, Talking Heads were wedged between two worlds: They were artsy outliers of the punk community too clean-cut and high-minded to really blend in at CBGB, yet too odd for listeners accustomed to a steady diet of Eagles and Fleetwood Mac.A few early singles like “Psycho Killer” and “Life During Wartime” snuck onto the charts by the end of the ’70s, buried under glossy hits by ABBA, Bee Gees, and Michael Jackson.Listening to their early catalog now, it’s clear their sense of melody didn’t get enough credit.Byrne didn’t have the easy star appeal of Barry Gibb, but by 1985, when Talking Heads released their sixth studio album Little Creatures, they’d become more melodic, more relatable: They’d made a pop album.“It’s so much fun to be able to relax and just play without feeling you have to be avant-garde all the time,” bassist Tina Weymouth told The New York Times’ Ken Emerson in May 1985, one month before the album’s release.“We spent so many years trying to be original that we don’t know what original is anymore.” Readers wouldn’t completely understand what she meant until July, when Little Creatures reached No.20 on the Billboard 200.After a decade in which they’d produced five pivotal LPs, each more unexpected than the last, Talking Heads had laid down their most approachable album ever.Little Creatures is a triumphant pop document that celebrates life’s simple joys, the exact thing Talking Heads once weaponized.By this point, the band had already run the gamut of creative endeavors.In addition to their hugely influential discography, they’d worked extensively with Brian Eno , recorded an expansive live album (1982’s The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads ), and collaborated with director Jonathan Demme on the groundbreaking and now-classic concert film Stop Making Sense .Critics keenly traced the arc of their success from RISD art obsessives to downtown punk affiliates to a 10-piece band of Afrobeat enthusiasts.Talking Heads’ love of funk and Afrobeat is alive and well on this album, evident in Weymouth’s walloping basslines and a smattering of hand drums; they also experiment with country western pedal steel (on “Creatures of Love”), bubbling synths (“Walk It Down”), and drumline snare (“Road to Nowhere”).But Little Creatures was about a lot more than a new batch of instruments in the studio.In a 1985 review, Rolling Stone insisted that Little Creatures was “the sound of David Byrne falling in love with normalcy.” Normalcy existed throughout Talking Heads’ catalog (what could be more normal than “buildings” and “food” ?), but Little Creatures is their first album to examine one of normalcy’s most complicated and significant corners: Procreative sex and parental love.Such milestones in Byrne’s own life—marriage with his then-girlfriend, artist Adelle Lutz, and the birth of their daughter, Malu—were still a few years away.Meanwhile, Talking Heads’ wedded rhythm section, Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, had a little creature of their own: Their son Robin arrived in 1982.Byrne didn’t immediately rush to write a song about him.“David’s so funny,” Frantz told Rolling Stone’s Christopher Connelly in 1983 .“He sort of wants to hold the baby, but he’ll never say, ‘Can I hold the baby?’ We just say, ‘David, would you like to hold the baby?’ And David gets all stiff, like, ‘Am I doing it right?’” By 1985, Byrne had caught the baby bug.Little Creatures is a celebration of love, procreation, and all the normal things Byrne used to treat with a sense of fear and alienation (this is a man who once sang: “They say compassion is a virtue, but I don’t have the time”).In a brief documentary from 1979 , Byrne sits, half in shadow, criticizing other rock’n’rollers for singing about everyday life in “rather mythic terms.” “People get very emotional about these, sort of, very mundane things,” Byrne says.“Grand events very rarely happen.” By the time Talking Heads wrote Little Creatures, grand events were happening every day—every second, even.On the calm and clean “Creatures of Love,” Bryne does nothing but marvel at the mundane.“Well, I’ve seen sex and I think it’s alright/It makes those little creatures come to life,” he sings.“Little creatures of love/With two arms and two legs/From a moment of passion/Now they cover the bed.” Looking outside of himself, Byrne found beauty in Frantz and Weymouth’s little family.Mid-album romp “Stay Up Late” is a far more jarring display of Byrne’s sudden fascination with toddlers.Driven by Jerry Harrison’s punching keyboard and big stadium drums, it’s the goofiest entry in Talking Heads’ catalog to date.Byrne demolishes any remaining scrap of stoicism: “Cute.Cute.Little baby/Little pee pee.Little toes,” he babbles.The song was a hit, parking on the charts for a full 10 weeks thanks to its fun, bouncing form: simple, rubbery bass, a lyrical nod to the Temptations , and a sing-along chorus.Perhaps Byrne’s paternal affections made him a more approachable frontman than the paranoid beanpole of yore.Still, no amount of artistic brilliance can justify the lyrics “little pee pee.” “Stay Up Late” is the album’s most literal song.Little Creatures functions best when Byrne speaks in relatable abstractions, allowing the band to translate them into expansive and buoyant pop songs.Opener “And She Was” and “The Lady Don’t Mind” are prime examples.They seem driven by Byrne’s unique approach to love, affectionate but not possessive.Amid the prickly guitar riffs, brass accents, and woodblock of “And She Was,” he observes a woman at her “pleasant elevation,” in awe of her ability to just be.On “The Lady Don’t Mind,” he calmly watches her travel from place to place, admiring her autonomy from afar.The verses are slithering and mysterious, flecked with hand percussion and winding guitar licks, perhaps a nod to this woman’s independent nature.But when the chorus bursts open, Byrne is ecstatic: “I like this curious feeling!” he sings.This is the sound of Talking Heads when their leader is hopelessly in love.In 1985, Little Creatures sounded like nothing Talking Heads had ever done before, and its staggering closer, “Road to Nowhere,” could be called their first proper anthem.It is simply enormous, with a gospel choir lead-in, Frantz’s one-man marching band, and an accordion slinking all over the place.It’s a vast, victorious ballad that builds and builds.Its titular road feels particularly significant: It is a device Byrne had once derided as just another way rock music made banality sound melodramatic.“Every trip down the highway was a huge experience,” he quipped in 1979, explaining his desire to treat such stimuli with realistic proportions.Just a few years later, he took his own trip, a metaphor for our journey through the great unknown.Little Creatures went on to sell over 2 million copies in the United States, becoming Talking Heads’ most successful studio album.Many critics attributed their aptitude for arena-sized pop songs to Frantz and Weymouth’s disco-tinged side project Tom Tom Club , but in retrospect, the band’s fate was sealed from the beginning.Tangled in the barbs of early albums like Talking Heads 77 and Fear of Music were jagged pop songs made all the more interesting by their lack of sheen and manipulation of convention.On Little Creatures, Talking Heads polished every surface of their sound.It wasn’t so much a step in the right direction as an inevitable conclusion for a band who, like everyone, must embrace adulthood at some point.Little Creatures is not Talking Heads’ best album, but it is their case for aging gracefully, and with great fondness for life.More

              " 'Pinterest For a band who often looked like they had just rolled in from recording Exile on Main Street, Royal Trux were far too abstruse to be genuinely retro.But recent noises from Neil Hagerty —former/current/ who knows?Royal Truck and now head honcho of the Howling Hex —have suggested a certain wistfulness in his dotage.“Rock and roll is what’s missing in bands these days that take a generic approach to playing that’s almost machine-like,” he harrumphed to Rolling Stone , indulging the kind of ruefully nostalgic statement that Liam Gallagher would tape to the studio mood board.The new Howling Hex album, Hagerty said, would be 100% real—a record, he promised elsewhere, that “people want to listen to without throwing it out the window.” To an extent, Hagerty keeps this promise on Knuckleball Express, the first Howling Hex album since Royal Trux’s ill-fated, occasionally wonderful reunion .Black Crowes fans will certainly find less to defenestrate than on 2013’s not-actually-a-best-of The Best of the Howling Hex , which was awash in polka rhythms, fuzz, and bizarre cowpunk lurch.“Lies,” the most immediate yet least satisfying track on Knuckleball Express, is a slice of heads-down Southern boogie, frenetic enough to raise a knowing smile without greatly troubling the cortex, while “Words” oozes with the leery strut of an acceptable Jagger outtake.Elsewhere, Knuckleball Express has enough of Royal Trux’s obstinate weirdness and willful rough edges to distinguish it from the retro blues of the barroom band.Hagerty’s guitar may be turned up as loud as you would expect of a man who has recently escaped an unhappy musical partnership, but there’s something deliciously unrefined about his playing, all jagged lines, rusty nails, and hangover shuffle.The drums have a similarly imperfect edge, their classic rock clip punctuated with a few too many lolloping tom rolls for comfort, while many songs shun the traditional verse/chorus structure in favor of bolting intros to riffs and solos to verses.“Heavy Curtains” sounds—brilliantly—like three unrelated songs welded together in a musical cut and shut .At its best, Knuckleball Express channels its awkwardness into songs that are thrilling in their instability.“Mr.Chicken” trembles on the edge of collapse before the unexpectedly well-mannered vocals of Kristine Shafer nudge the song into Belle and Sebastian -meets- Pussy Galore territory.“Cowboy Motors\" throws a harpsichord into the mix for no particular reason, like a cruel parody of 1960s baroque pop, while “North Aquarian” introduces a drunken-sounding face-off between drummer and electronic squiggles—hardly Beatrice Dillon in its audacity, but modish enough to remind you that Knuckleball Express was recorded this millennium.This waywardness is important.The tensions that drove Royal Trux, like many bands before them, were the same impulses that eventually unraveled the group.The risk for Knuckleball Express was that Hagerty, safely ensconced in Colorado with no tempestuous bandmate to spark off, might have succumbed to the easy musical life.Certainly, there are moments here—like “City in the Country,” where he hymns the “sweet Rocky Mountain waves”—that suggest a certain mellowing.But Hagerty remains as wily and weird as ever.Full of charm, panache, and eccentric raw power, Knuckleball Express makes good on his promise to make something real.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for The Howling Hex',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Let’s just get this out of the way: Stay Inside would have been just as timely of a band name at any point in the Brooklyn group’s short existence.On their bracing debut Viewing, bassist/vocalist Bryn Nieboer reckons with what she calls “the worst thing that happened to me in my life,” framing her personal trauma within the generational traumas of the last four years.Viewing is the work of a band formed amidst ongoing biological and political disasters, and the songs explore end-times questions: What is the purpose of creation in a state of perpetual impermanence?What is the meaning of forgiveness and hope when the arc of the moral universe is irreversibly off course?Stay Inside’s music shares the physique of Travis Bickle or Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, if not their regressive nihilism—they sound gaunt and wiry, the songs’ shredded musculature meant to frighten more than impress, developed in isolation as a defense mechanism to New York’s daily interpersonal cruelties.Viewing moves at a dyspeptic churn, its melodies alternately soaring and sour, their imagery borne of a lonesome, crowded Brooklyn, full of corrosives and irritants.Stay Inside earmark their arrangements with reminders of abject and vivid squalor that pop up like roaches—a recurring burst of feedback used to segue between tracks, the burrowing one-note riff of “Revisionist,” the chords of “Veil” slowly denaturing into atonality.“The picture’s weak/Everything’s a copy that I’m copying,” guitarist and vocalist Chris Johns sings on the opening “Revisionist,” in Viewing’s predominant pose: a snarl and a shrug.Having gotten a bombastically titled EP out of their system (2018’s The Sea Engulfs Us and the Light Goes Out ), Stay Inside here commit to clarity, reducing the past two decades of emo and post-hardcore’s most serious variants into its most potent concentrate, stripped of pretensions.Each track hones its essence into urgent, mononym titles, with nothing in the arrangements to detract from their focused messages.A visit to the spacious, twinkling skies of Midwestern emo is pointedly called “Divide,” Viewing’s sole and fleeting beacon of light before Side B plunges towards the abyss.At their most anthemic (“Ivy,” “Monument”), Stay Inside fuse screamo brutality with post-punk elegance, suggesting an alternate history where Interpol recorded Turn on the Bright Lights with the guy from seminal screamo band Saetia still on drums.Viewing is one of the most confidently executed emo debuts of recent vintage, and it’s poignant to wonder what the live show would be like.Emo albums are usually made with sweaty, crowded, all-ages shout-alongs in mind, the kind of experience quarantine has rendered impossible.But unlike, say, Dogleg’s transcendent Melee , Viewing doesn’t feel designed as group therapy meant to foster togetherness.True to the name, Stay Inside finds purpose and nobility in doing push ups in a stuffy apartment, sublimating anger into action, working through shit in isolation before rejoining society—an aim that will make it just as relevant when the next disaster strikes.10 to Hear Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week Sign Up Now',\n",
              " 'Pinterest It happens to most of us at an early age: the realization that life will not follow a straight line on the path towards fulfillment.Instead, life spirals.The game is rigged, power corrupts, and society is, in a word, bullshit .Art can expose the lies.The early music of Fiona Apple was so much about grand betrayals by inadequate men and the patriarchal world.Did it teach you to hate yourself?Did it teach you to bury your pain, to let it calcify, to build a gate around your heart that quiets the reaches of your one and only voice?Fetch the bolt cutters.Fiona Apple’s fifth record is unbound.No music has ever sounded quite like it.Apple recorded Fetch the Bolt Cutters both in and with her Venice Beach home, banging on its walls, stomping on its ground.Self-reliance is its rule, curiosity is its key.Fetch the Bolt Cutters seems to almost completely turn the volume down on music history, while it cranks up raw, real life—handclaps, chants, and other makeshift percussion, in harmony with space, echoes, whispers, screams, breathing, jokes, so-called mistakes, and dog barks.(At least five dogs are credited: Mercy, Maddie, Leo, Little, and Alfie.)All of this debris orbits around the core of Apple’s music: her voice, her piano, and most of all her words, which have always been her primary instrument.It creates a wild symphony of the everyday.In the past, Apple has said John Lennon was her god, and she wrote lyrics and melodies on par with the finest pop songs ever recorded.But Fetch the Bolt Cutters feels more conceptually akin to the revolutionary risk-taking of saint Yoko Ono—a woman who once wrote, “I like to fight the establishment by using methods that are so far removed from establishment-type thinking that the establishment doesn’t know how to fight back.” Fetch the Bolt Cutters does something similar.It contains practically no conventional pop forms.Taken together, the notes of its found percussion and rattling blues are liberationist.Apple was moving towards all of this with 2012’s The Idler Wheel .Even after the fury and eloquence of her initial three-album run—manifestos from a voice of disenchantment who knew even as a teenager that she was “ too smart ” for the world—Idler Wheel still felt like a breakthrough.It was the first Apple record to realize the breadth of her potential in the ecstatic reach of the music itself.On the corporeal “Daredevil,” she sang of “gashes” that gave her “lift.” But on Fetch the Bolt Cutters she calls the gashes out by name: “bullies,” “it girls,” “wannabes,” and, above all, toxic masculinity.Apple said, in a recent profile in The New Yorker , that she worried she’d constructed “a record that can’t be made into a record,” but that shakiness was merely a symptom of a feat of total abandon.The whole album flies.The opening song, “I Want You to Love Me” seems to offer a thesis for the meaning of life: to love, to connect, to get “back in the pulse.” She sings, scats, lightly raps—and proceeds to curl her voice into an extended-vocal contortion à la Yoko or Meredith Monk, over a Reichian piano loop, signaling an avant-garde inclination.Apple sings about time and meaninglessness, and how “while I’m in this body I want somebody to want.” She sings about knowing that one day she will die.The song echoes the beautiful open letter she wrote in 2012 about her dog, Janet, who was then dying: “I know that I will feel the most overwhelming knowledge of her [...] in the last moments.” Apple reportedly “tapped” on a box containing Janet’s bones during the recording of the album.There is a tendency among songwriters, as they get older, to refine—to use fewer words to allow for easier melodies.But to refine is to reel back, to withdraw.Apple does the opposite, reimagining her music to accommodate even more words, more of herself: “You’ve got to get what you want/How you want it/But so do I,” she sings on “Drumset,” grasping at every self-determined syllable.A number of Fetch the Bolt Cutters’ rough-hewn tracks sound like they might collapse at any moment, only to pick themselves up with a smirk of cool relief.The incantatory “Relay” includes a fluttering ambient noise jam recalling no one so much as O.G.punk band the Slits.Across four distinct movements, the madcap “For Her” pivots from a cabaret tune to a march to a swooping blues ballad to a one-woman choir of antagonizing angels.It is the definition of uncompromising.Apple’s indictments of men are also cutting as ever—“Your face ignites a fuse to my patience,” goes “Cosmonauts”—but her vulnerabilities are more daring, too.In a single word, her voice can dive from a ragged scream to a whisper so intimate that it barely exists outside of her.Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Ambar Lucid is 19, but she’s already lived through her father’s deportation, the naysayer who told her no one would listen to her music if it was in Spanish, and the move to Los Angeles to pursue that music anyway.Garden of Lucid, her defiant debut album, exudes confidence and experience.Her style of R&B is mystical and moody, a supernatural dream for anyone seeking to better understand the world and their place in it.It all builds to an image of a young woman who understands who she is and wants everyone else to understand, too.Because it’s tricky being a teenage girl.You’re either too much like a woman or too much like a child, always making other people uncomfortable or feeling uncomfortable yourself.As a teen in charge of her own art, Lucid shares her life without shame.“I belong to the universe/I don’t belong to anyone else,” she sings on “Universe,” a glittery, groovy song with a bassline like Tame Impala for girls who own tarot cards.Such trite lyrical moments serve as reminders that Lucid is a new adult—or put differently, they’re testaments to her earnestness.On “Story to Tell,” she sings plainly, “My art was awkward for you to tell,” and then, “Farewell.” On “Garden,” she adopts the same kind of droopy guitar loop you might hear in emo rap, with an indulgent, sinister vocal delivery to match.“Welcome to the garden,” Lucid sings, like she’s the ringleader of a weird dreamland circus.But then she says something unexpectedly sympathetic: “Please don’t be disheartened/Once you perceive insincerity,” dipping in and out of Spanish from there.Her voice is decadent, forming crystalline falsettos on “Cuando” and cutting through piano on “Shades of Blue.” She goes low and high, a vocal acrobat.It’s easy to hear the imprint of Odd Future associates like Kali Uchis and Steve Lacy on this album; Lucid has named both as influences.She shares their sense of darkness, lavishing in wonky, washed-out guitar, sticky basslines, and fuzzy background vocals.It’s alternative R&B with a wink, something always left a little strange.Yet Lucid’s lush, sweeping vocal performances and the assertive, spiritual self-compassion in her lyrics stand out from the rest of Odd Future’s disciples.She translates the anxious beauty of an artist like Lil Peep into a focused pain.You don’t often hear Spanish in the lyrics of an American artist making this sort of grungy R&B, which reaffirms that Lucid is no one’s token anything.For a generation of immigrants’ children, hearing Lucid, a 19-year-old girl with a Dominican mother and Mexican father, so easily integrate her culture with her musical identity feels like a personal homecoming.When I was younger, I never knew exactly how I felt about my own immigrant parents.I envied other neighborhood kids, the ones whose families were all-white, all-American, and uncomplicated.High school friends told me that I was white, even though my dad was from Bangladesh.Eventually, I stopped protesting—sure, I was white, too.Not until I was older did I realize how much denying my background severed me from my identity.On Garden of Lucid, the multifaceted teenage girl has control of her own narrative.Lucid is a burgeoning Latinx American pop star; her music is strange and luminous, sometimes in English and sometimes in Spanish, and almost always about herself.It tells everyone that immigrant kids are complicated and idiosyncratic, never conforming to the image that others (our parents, our neighbors) want to project on us.There’s no attempt to pander, to sing the kind of story about the tragedy or triumph of immigration that white Americans love to hear.Everyone is always telling teenagers what to do, but Lucid isn’t looking for help.She’s just waiting for everyone else to catch up.More Reviews for Ambar Lucid',\n",
              " 'Pinterest On In Another Life, Active Child’s Pat Grossi offers cinematic strings, surging choral harmonies, and his dazzling harp as a kind of spiritual balm, a respite from the harsh outside world.Frequently, his new album sounds like church music (which comes as no surprise, given his roots as a choir boy ).On the anthemic album closer, he urges us to “Hold your head up/Even though it’s a cruel world.” But Grossi never fully introduces the conflict or cruelty of that world into the realm of his compositions—there is no ugliness here, only affirmation, and sounds as pristine as the upholstering on the album cover.This is the Pasadena-based musician’s first release in five years, and his major-label debut for Sony.In a note shared to Twitter , he alluded to the fact that this release had been “with me for too long really”; he also mentions that he began composing it after the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015.These attacks were perhaps the impetus for the soothing, sympathetic offerings on In Another Life like “Cruel World,” and “Brighter Day,” though Grossi also cites death and the birth of his daughter as songwriting inspirations.The loosely circling themes feel almost irrelevant; the textures are what’s most striking.Grossi has largely ditched the soft-rock sheen of his 2015 album Mercy , returning to full-bodied strings and choral chamber-pop dotted with electronic flourishes.When he’s in this mode, Active Child sounds glorious.But perhaps even more impactful than the grandiose moments are the lower, more somber offerings.“Spirit Buoy” is a showcase for his delicate double-tracked vocal and harp, while he delivers a horror movie-worthy distorted vocal in his trembling higher register on “Color Me,” the record’s only thrillingly discordant moment.On lead single “Weightless,” the percussive hand claps resound viscerally in your eardrums and the dam-bursting strings lead to a dramatic payoff that feels earned.Elsewhere, Grossi creates moments of bombast that fall flat because of the platitudes at their center.“Weightless” is followed by “Brighter Day,” a dusky track that urges its listeners to “Love one another/Help your brother/Lean on each other.” These cliches are met with no tension; as with the sunny “keep your head up” hook on “Cruel World,” they shimmer earnestly over a bed of powerful drums and Hollywood strings, offering nothing but uplift for uplift’s sake.Grossi often hints at shadows in his lyrics, but shies away from looking directly at the objects casting these shadows.On “In Another Life,” he sings that we’re surrounded by “something bigger”; on “Cruel World,” he dedicates himself to “something richer,” but in both instances he swerves away from specificity.There’s a hollowness to this worship, though Grossi plugs the gap with distractingly beautiful arrangements.It is an unmistakably lovely record, which is occasionally stifled by its own loveliness.More Reviews for Active Child',\n",
              " 'Pinterest John Darnielle’s music has arrived so steadily and with such consistency that the changes the Mountain Goats have undergone can feel secondary to his own growth as a writer.Over the last three decades, a project with the loneliest of origins—a man at home with an acoustic guitar, a primitive tape recorder, and a pinched, inimitable voice—has grown into a full band with their own distinctive and expanding sound.Their albums from the past 10 years have seen an increased focus on the musicians around him: longtime bassist Peter Hughes, drummer Jon Wurster, multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas, and collaborators that have ranged from a men’s choir to a metal producer, a symphony orchestra and a horn section.You could imagine a trajectory in which Darnielle blends deeper into this foreground, exploring how each new embellishment affects the cadence of his rich, referential storytelling.This was the plan as recently as a month ago, when the quartet gathered to work on the follow-up to 2019’s lush In League With Dragons .But as the effects of COVID-19 made it impossible to continue recording together, and as the material Darnielle prepared began to feel at odds with the escalating news cycle, he returned home and changed plans.In his bedroom, during 90-minute breaks away from his family, he wrote one new song a day, all inspired by A Chronicle of the Last Pagans, a dense text published in 1990 by the French historian Pierre Chuvin.For the sake of immediacy—and maybe familiarity—he recorded each song on the Panasonic RX-FT500 boombox that documented his earliest compositions.This very boombox, purchased in the late ’80s, served as Darnielle’s first essential collaborator, its harsh, unrelenting whirr once inseparable from his songwriting.It was so integral that a portion of his devoted fan base felt betrayed when he signed to 4AD after 2002’s classic All Hail West Texas and took to professional studios, adopted cleaner textures, and, eventually, recruited a band.For this contingent of fans, his new album, Songs for Pierre Chuvin, might signal a long-awaited return to form; it is a brief but thoughtful collection marked by old-school production, deep allusions to his songbook, and performances that could be placed among those early pillars.Yet it doesn’t feel like pandering.Despite the familiar sound and old-world setting (4th and 5th century, to be exact), these songs never look back for too long.They feel like another step forward.Over the years, Darnielle has become increasingly adept at summarizing the disparate worldviews of his characters in catchy, unlikely refrains.As with everything he puts to tape, there are a couple here that you could sing along with by the time the second verse starts.The chorus of the opening song, “Aulon Raid,” sets the tone: “We will deeeeal with you/Me and my paaaa-gan crew.” These observations from a collapsing society are at turns hopeful, wistful, and enraged.Alone, Darnielle takes audible delight in finding the right backdrop for each story, from the Casio hum of “The Wooded Hills Along the Black Sea” to the terse grind of “Until Olympius Returns.” Even if you have never been a member of a small community fearing extinction—say, ancient pagans at the hands of Christians, or lo-fi purists bemoaning a more polished technique—his words ring with righteous purpose.Amid the social distancing and mass cancellations of the past month, I had already been thinking about Darnielle’s music.His catalog is filled with odes to the small communities we build for ourselves: the divine congregations at rock concerts (“Satanic Messiah”) and wrestling matches (2015’s Beat the Champ ); among people with similar dependencies (2004’s We Shall All Be Healed) and fashion choices (2017’s Goths ).He has also written from pockets of deep isolation.His quiet 2006 album Get Lonely is devoted entirely to this subject, with an opening track that spends its runtime contemplating the inherent danger of leaving the house.Pierre Chuvin finds its place among these desperate stories.“Return the peace you took from me/Give me back my community,” he sings late in the album.In another song, a character casts a skeptical eye from his hillside exile: “Sometimes forget there’s cities down there,” he chants in a matter-of-fact verse, his tone somewhere between self-sufficiency and total alienation.In moments like these, Darnielle’s writing feels newly political and wide-reaching, a comforting shift from the more insular narratives of his last few concept albums.But he closes the record with a nod to his own mythology.On the climactic “Exegetic Chains,” Darnielle expresses gratitude for the faithful grind of his boombox and repurposes the chorus of his signature song : “Make it through this year,” he urges in a near-whisper, “if it kills us outright.” It’s the echo of a message that’s often shouted through tears at the end of his shows: a personal mantra turned outward, an old prayer sung like intimate advice.This, he suggests, is how we might get by.When he started writing songs, recording to tape was a necessity: a quick, inexpensive way to document his thoughts.Now it’s a gesture of faith.The proceeds from this release go to his bandmates and crew, the people who count on his work for income.The initial run sold out in minutes; it’s currently in its third pressing.He wants to make sure the people who need it can hear it, that they can hold it in their hands.Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Hamilton, Ontario’s Linnea Siggelkow decided to learn guitar at age 12, when she saw the music video for Avril Lavigne’s “Complicated.” As the daughter of a piano teacher, it was her first departure from sheet music.When she began writing her own songs, she found herself drawn towards melancholy.That’s the mood that defines Ellis , the dream-pop project she started in her bedroom some four years ago.A series of early GarageBand demos attracted attention, earning her opening slots for Soccer Mommy and Palehound .Her debut LP, Born Again, is an opportunity to hear Ellis in her own right.But with sentimental lyrics and familiar emo-pop tropes—gentle guitar reverb, windswept synths, overblown crescendos—the album too often falls back on cliché.As the title suggests, Born Again charts Ellis’ disillusionment with her religious upbringing and its lingering effects on her state of mind.“In the pews I lost my hope/Where I was supposed to find it,” she sings in a soft, pining voice reminiscent of contemporaries like Nicole Dollanganger , Long Beard , and Tomberlin .She confesses to a shame “that I will carry ’til I’m dead,” but the feeling doesn’t grade into the music.There’s little specificity, nor much variation in mood, so that even songs with ambiguous, conflicted meanings are subsumed into echoey haze.The closing track takes a hopeful tone—“Had a dream I was a butterfly,” Ellis sings—but it relies on the same sparse guitar, synth overlay, and middle-eight upsurge as “Into the Trees,” a song about dysfunctional relationships and dread.When Ellis’ unique perspective does emerge, it offers beauty like “a brief gasp between one cliché and another,” in the words of Ezra Pound.“I thought I had found freedom/When I moved into the city/I was puking out the window/I was trying to be pretty,” she sings on the title track—an image so detailed and so arbitrary, it could only be her own.By contrast, lines like, “You’re the monster that still hides under my bed/You’re the words that I thought but never said” (from “Shame”) are so wholly reliant on cliché that there’s little hope of saying anything new.At other times, Ellis struggles to put words to her emotions.“I can’t explain the feeling,” she admits on “Happy”; “I don’t know why, I just feel like a mess,” she sings on “Into the Trees.” With nowhere else to go for emphasis or meaning, she simply gets louder, adding all-caps declarations of “I’m scared” that counteract the very feeling she wants to convey.Open-heartedness can act as a salve in an irony-hardened world, but the sweet kitsch of Born Again leaves little to latch onto.The songs are buttressed by predictable structures—soft, then bombastic, then soft again—with little room for surprise.The grungy, tuned-down guitar starts just when it’s expected; ditto the pitter-pattering drums and the starry synths that merge the other components together.All the soupy atmospherics wind up obscuring Ellis’ attempts at honest self-reflection.Uniformly and unashamedly sentimental, Born Again leaves too little to remember her by.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for Ellis',\n",
              " 'Pinterest In a goofy teaser clip for his new album, Hamilton Leithauser seems to state the obvious: “Writing and recording music by yourself can be lonely.” This is only the former Walkman ’s second solo record, following 2014’s Black Hours and a collaborative LP with Rostam .But The Loves of Your Life is far from a solitary work; it is filled with people—both those firmly planted in Leithauser’s world, and those who’ve wandered through by chance.Each of its 11 songs was written about a specific person, and while some names and details have changed, the album is a celebration of community and the relationships that make one possible.It’s an archive of memories that comes alive with the help of Leithauser’s elevated songcraft and dynamic voice.Leithauser’s recording process likewise embraced community.Alongside pros like pianist Jon Batiste and pedal steel player Jonathan Gregg, you’ll find Leithauser’s wife Anna Stumpf, their daughters Georgiana and Frederika, and the girls’ former preschool teacher, Lacrisha Brown, all credited for backing vocals.Leithauser layers their voices expertly throughout the record, in melodies that breeze around the songs and occasionally build into a full-bodied choir.He plays tricks with his own vocals as well, burying muted harmonies and delayed echoes around the edges of the mix.On the brooding “Til Your Ship Comes In,” his voice is in full force, hitting a high Rod Stewart rasp in the chorus and warbling out like warped tape elsewhere.The Loves of Your Life examines an assortment of relationships for which Leithauser conveys deep affection.He loves these characters and wants to understand them, even on “Here They Come,” about a friend hiding from reality in the darkness of the Union Square cinema, or “Isabella,” about a “wide-eyed” Manhattan party girl who dropped out of college long ago.The skyward melodies of “Isabella” mimic the muse: a hopeless romantic staving off adulthood with endless late nights.Leithauser doesn’t denounce Isabella, but attempts to comprehend her dreams, her loneliness.“I wanna be there with her,” he sings, “’til they all go riding home.” The coda grows and grows, Leithauser’s in-house choir lifting it up until it floats away.On “Til Your Ship Comes In,” the sense of being surrounded by familiar faces feels like an intervention; anyone who’s dealt with a self-destructive friend or relative will recognize the theme.“You’re kidding me, right?/With that dot in your eye,” Leithauser growls, watching police lights flash in the street.The layers of vocal tracks have an encircling effect: The subject is locked in a room with people who care too much to let them out.“Everybody wants you in a different way,” Leithauser sings.A dozen voices strong, the refrain feels particularly indicting: “We call you by a different name.” Leithauser’s knack for melody is stronger than ever, particularly on “Isabella” and the big, bittersweet “Wack Jack,” which chronicles an unresolved conflict that drove one party to walk out for good.Caleb Cressman sits in on pedal steel and Batiste lays down a nimble solo, but Leithauser does the rest: drums, bass, guitar, mandolin, synthesizers, Wurlitzer, and vocals.“‘Years from today, when your name is just a name/And my love is a couple candles, twinkling on your cake,’” Leithauser sings, quoting the lost friend’s parting words, “‘That burn won’t hurt you anymore/But I’ll still keep your picture lying in a drawer.’” It’s the kind of remark that ends fights instantly: calm, vicious, poignant.The Loves of Your Life feels like a neighborhood that’s deeply familiar, yet so packed with life that new details emerge on each stroll.You’ll find rainbows streaking through oily puddles, lipstick-kissed cups, breeze-blown magazines, a glossy red Silverado.If you walk long enough, you’ll also get to know the people that live there.Leithauser would like you to meet them.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for Hamilton Leithauser',\n",
              " 'Pinterest What if the worries that keep you awake at night—fear of commitment, awareness of mortality, the inevitability of loss—could, instead, motivate you during the day?That is the gist of Trace Mountains ’ Lost in the Country, a brisk indie rock record that bluntly addresses our deepest concerns and transmutes them into 10 winning anthems about persevering.In the worldview of Dave Benton, the Trace Mountains singer-songwriter who gathered a studio band to shape these songs, the cure is sometimes as simple as a long walk in the woods or a solitary cry in a foreign rock club.Or maybe it’s recognizing, as he does here more than once, that funneling your sadness into a tune just to make it through another day is perfectly acceptable.Lost in the Country responds to novel modern afflictions—the inadequacy that stems from witnessing everyone else’s glamour on social media, or the generational unease of a forsaken future—with Benton’s own survival guide, as comforting for its candor as it is accessible for its instant hooks.Benton is an acolyte of big-guitar indie rock, particularly records that counter the self-doubt and systemic confusion of early adulthood with the bliss of getting loud in a room with your pals.His sacred texts start somewhere around Dinosaur Jr.’s 1987 landmark You’re Living All Over Me , include Built to Spill’s 1994 opus There’s Nothing Wrong With Love , and run up to the War on Drugs’ 2014 breakthrough Lost in the Dream (cannily namechecked by this album’s very title).His devotion has been clear for nearly a decade, first on the hulking albums he made with the promising but departed LVL UP , and on his own as Trace Mountains.His lo-fi debut supplied pure Bright Eyes and Sebadoh pastiche.When he kicked on the amps for 2018’s A Partner to Lean On as LVL UP wound down , he seemed adrift, sad and searching for his own sound.Musically and emotionally, Lost in the Country is a decisive step forward.Those familiar references still abound—the title track might have fit on a turn-of-the-millennium Barsuk compilation , wedged somewhere between Death Cab and John Vanderslice , while the assured solo that ends “Rock & Roll” seems salvaged from A Deeper Understanding ’s scrap heap.Benton name-checks that War on Drugs album on the title track, too, reinforcing his devotion to the romantic sweep of epic rock’n’roll, recast for the budgetary constraints of someone who recently quit his bigger band.There’s a newfound poise to these songs, an effortlessness in both conception and delivery that suggests Benton’s music can mirror his heroes while capturing his own experiences, too.Even when he gilds “Cooper’s Dream” with singing saw and glockenspiel or “I Am Leaving You” with blaring surges of bright organ lines, he turns his old loves into your new sing-alongs.That brightness lifts Benton through the darkest parts of these songs.On “Me & May” he considers the implications of a breakup, pondering the parallel universe where he’s still happy and satisfied.Benton acknowledges the regret of choosing one timeline instead of another, but incandescent harmonies and spring-loaded drums guide him to the realization that he did the best he could with what he knew—all any of us can do, he suggests, until we are “drifting into a dream.” Again contemplating the choices we’re forced to make during “Dog Country,” he reflects on leaving Brooklyn for the woods of the Hudson Valley, pondering what he might have lost or gained.Pedal steel and a bucolic shuffle comfort him like hands on his shoulders, tempering FOMO’s bittersweet sting.Lost in the Country’s sanguine mood and full embrace of its indie-rock predecessors run the risk of making Benton sound overly hopeful or naïve, the ostrich plunging its head beneath the surface to ignore the relentless bad news.But Benton is not above or apart from any of it.Especially near the album’s end, he reveals just how low he’s been.“Fallin’ Rain” opens with Benton at his most despondent, his tone furrowed over storm clouds of dark piano chords.And during “Absurdity,” he routes his voice through a tremolo pedal until it shakes like a dead leaf in a windstorm.“We are all on our own/There is no kindness/There is only violence—and smartphones,” he sings with a tremor that recalls Phil Elverum , tenderly rattling off a litany of existential laments.But Benton doesn’t wallow in these pits of self-pity.Instead, he uses them as opportunities to change his circumstances and outlook, to climb out and look at the world around him and tell us about the process.As he marvels at an infinite hillside during “Fallin’ Rain,” he gets lost in something bigger than himself, something that will outlast “this hopeless heartache.” An acoustic guitar and bright electronics sparkle like prisms in the sun, echoing his epiphany.Even then, Benton’s voice remains as fragile as the feelings of inadequacy and guilt he’s fighting.That vulnerability testifies to our daily battles with our deepest insecurities, even after those fleeting moments when it feels like we’ve won.And as it enters its second half, “Absurdity” steadily rises above its misery and torpor, a languid guitar solo leading to a verse that’s as life-affirming as indie rock gets.The most involved song in Benton’s catalog, it moves seamlessly through four distinct sections, like low-stakes prog-rock, to illustrate his lifting mood.It’s a testament to his broader musical and narrative ambitions, perhaps a suggestion of how far he can push his elemental indie rock lineage.Above a suddenly funky beat that suggests summer days spent listening to jam bands, Benton relays a breathless story about hiking among the evergreen trees on a canyon rim.He’s stunned by the sight and feels free, at least until his phone buzzes in his pocket, drawing him back into a world of “true absurdity.” But he remembers now that he’s happy to be here at all, blinking in the daylight.“I guess this means that I can be a part of the ever-unfolding daydream,” he sings, his voice betraying a wry smile.Sometimes, there’s no escaping the sense that we’re living in shit, he seems to say.But at least it means we’re alive, always with something left to fix.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for Trace

              " 'Pinterest Under the Donald J. Trump administration, singing about migration is an explicitly political act.But M. Ward is constitutionally predisposed towards mystery and understatement, so his Migration Stories sidesteps protests and outrages.The album, Ward’s 10th as a solo artist, unfurls at a deliberate pace, luxuriating in a dreamworld conjured out of memories, shared stories, and flights of fancy.Though 21st-century headlines may have been Ward’s initial inspiration for Migration Stories, he declines to write about current controversies.Instead, they’re a context for Ward’s grander design, which is focused on the emotional and spiritual motivations for migration.Some of his intent stems from his own family history, specifically his grandfather’s journey from Mexico to the United States at the dawn of the 20th century.Ward doesn’t tackle this story directly.He instead evokes that era through a dreamy cover of “Along the Santa Fe Trail,” a tune written for the 1940 western film Santa Fe Trail, which he initially encountered in a version by the singing cowboy Jimmy Wakely.Ward moves “Along the Santa Fe Trail” away from its origins and toward the spacy, untethered roots-rock that’s been his calling card for the better part of two decades.He traveled to Montreal to work with producer Craig Silvey—the first time he’s cut an album with a co-producer—at Arcade Fire’s studio, recording with band members Richard Reed Parry and Tim Kingsbury.All the new collaborators don’t radically reshape Ward’s music so much as expand its parameters.The difference between the new and old is made clear by the handful of tracks Ward recorded and produced on his own.“Chamber Music,” along with the instrumentals “Stevens’ Snowman” and “Rio Drone,” are delicate and contained, where the rest of the record seems to spread out across a starry sky.Much of this picturesque quality stems from the subtle contributions of Parry and Kingsbury or, in the case of the album opener “Migration of Souls,” the spectral supporting vocals of the Lost Brothers.Harmonies float through the songs, intertwining with gossamer slides of synthesizers, the arrangements accentuating the dusty twang of Ward’s guitar and his whispered singing.Often, these sounds are felt as much as heard, adding depth and dimension to a collection of songs that suggest a faded nocturnal transmission from a mid-century radio station deep in the Southwest.Unlike 2016’s More Rain , the tempo never quite quickens (“Unreal City” is the only song with a propulsive pulse, but even that is muted) and the volume never rises.Nor is there a sense of levity—a quality that surfaced on 2018’s What a Wonderful Industry, Ward’s otherwise barbed letter to the music business.Migration Stories simply drifts along at its own lazy pace, letting its pretty textures become the connective tissue.Sometimes, Ward’s words break through the haze.Images of families and lovers striving to reconnect, either in this world or the next, float to the surface, as do visions of traveling shows, David Bowie’s Major Tom, and displaced wanderers searching for a home they’ve seen only in dreams.All these passages paint a picture of souls in transition, literally and spiritually, hinting at the reasons people choose to leave their country for another.Ward’s decision to not directly confront the immigration horrors of modern times isn’t cowardly; it’s entirely in character.As a singer and songwriter, he specializes in miniatures and suggestions, taking indirect routes to simple truths.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for M.

              " 'Pinterest In the summer of 2005, Joni Mitchell was at peace.She was 61 years old, three years into retirement, and leading a life that, in her words , consisted mostly of “being a granny and watching a lot of television.” One particular day, she was sitting outside the Vancouver home where she wrote ’70s masterpieces like For the Roses and Court and Spark .She watched the Pacific Ocean sprawl in the distance.Herons flew overhead; roses bloomed in the garden.When she came back inside, she sat at the piano and translated the view into a serene, sentimental melody.It was her first new composition in years.She wanted to call it “Gratitude.” She ended up going with “One Week Last Summer” and placing it as the opening track on 2007’s Shine, her first collection of new songs in over a decade and her last album to date.At the time of release, it was largely perceived as a response to turbulent times: the Bush administration, the Iraq War, the deterioration of our planet.Revisiting it now upon its first vinyl release, its songs still feel urgent, but they also sound untethered to any political moment.“I did a lot of weeping for what’s happening to the Earth when I was in my twenties,” Mitchell said at the time.“I could see a lot of things coming.” Even at its most hopeless, Shine observes chaos from a distance that feels centered and assured; these are protest songs delivered as solemn premonitions.Recorded mostly alone with engineer Dan Marnien, Shine has its own distinct atmosphere.Mitchell’s ’80s work was defined by a busy, glossy pop sound that purposefully contrasted with her darker worldview, while her ’90s albums returned her to the soft, sophisticated arrangements of her most celebrated era.With flourishes of MIDI orchestras and droning synth pads, peculiar jazz phrasings and muted horns, Shine feels akin to late-career work by her peers—somewhere between Leonard Cohen ’s synthetic hymnals and Van Morrison ’s smooth-jazz vision quests.Its most adventurous moment (“Hana”) lurches and grinds to skittering percussion, while its ballads feature little more than her worn-out vocals and downcast piano playing.Often Mitchell uses textures from throughout her catalog like Ghosts of Christmas Past: “When this place looks like a moonscape,” she sings over the acoustic coffeehouse strum of “This Place,” “Don’t say I didn’t warn ya.” The themes that dominate this album are ones that Mitchell had turned to over and over throughout her catalog.To prove her point that these modern worries are nothing new, she includes a revamped rendition of her 1970 hit “Big Yellow Taxi,” reorchestrating it with bursts of accordion and saxophone.Even if it’s one of the less essential inclusions on the record, its placement showcases the consistency and self-contained philosophy of her songbook.It also draws attention to what’s changed.Mitchell’s voice on Shine is a fascinating instrument: a yellowed photograph, frayed and fading.On Both Sides Now and Travelogue, early-’00s albums that felt like epilogues, Mitchell was backed by an orchestra, revisiting old songs in elegant settings.On Shine, she’s accompanied by sparse atmospheres that bring her strained, ghostly delivery into focus.This was by design: “I am closer to the singers I love,” she explained.“I never imagined I’d be able to sing like Edith Piaf.” It makes sense that she was thrilled by her transformation, by challenging expectations with each breath.By the time Mitchell released Shine in the fall of 2007, she had completed two equally ambitious artistic projects: an exhibit of her recent, apocalyptic photography and a sprawling narrative dance piece with the Alberta Ballet Company.She had originally been asked to collaborate on a biographical show soundtracked by her hits.She said no: “I’m not interested in escapist entertainment when the planet is at red alert.” She speaks to a similar desire in the album’s title track, where, over the span of seven and a half minutes, she casts a light on all corners of the earth, calling out people by name and profession, forecasting great destruction and confusion ahead.At times it sounds like a list of grievances, her tone purposefully unpoetic.But the implied message is that it’s not too late to turn around.“When the world becomes a massive mess with nobody at the helm,” she said , “It’s time for artists to make their mark.” On Shine, Mitchell sings with wisdom and grace, sadness and compassion.Her mark is indelible.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for Joni Mitchell',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Just as the clock struck midnight on a new decade, Julian Casablancas delivered the news that Strokes fans had been waiting to hear.“The 2010s, whatever the fuck they’re called, we took ‘em off,” he announced at the band’s New Year’s Eve show in Brooklyn.“And now we’ve been unfrozen and we’re back.” No matter where the last 10 years have left you— Angles defender, Voidz apologist, Meet Me in the Bathroom nostalgist who gave up hope a long time ago—it was easy to feel a trickle of excitement.After all, what Strokes fan wouldn’t want to believe this band’s spotty recent output was the result of a long-dormant period and not because, you know, they all hate each other and have a dozen other projects they’d rather focus on?And what better time to launch their comeback than a holiday marked by great expectations and even greater partying?The New Abnormal, the Strokes’ sixth album and first in seven years, mostly just feels like a hangover.It’s sluggish and slight, and the strongest hooks are so familiar that they require additional writing credits for the ’80s hits they copy note-for-note (Billy Idol’s “Dancing With Myself” in “Bad Decisions,” Psychedelic Furs’ “The Ghost in You” in “Eternal Summer”).Of course, the Strokes have never been subtle with their references—that’s part of the fun—but they’ve become increasingly uninterested in the tight, classic songcraft that once felt entirely their own.With producer Rick Rubin, a presence so hands-off as to feel merely symbolic, their signature sound is rendered as background music, a set of bleary-eyed mood pieces, all hovering around the five-minute mark before fizzling out with a shrug.A generous read is that it’s a style they have never attempted before: pushing their songs to their limits, maintaining a state of Zen in their machinelike interplay.In the nearly 20 years since Is This It, the Strokes have never quite found a way to successfully expand on their blueprint.There are the loungey, drum-less ballads you can expect to find about halfway through all their tracklists (“Ask Me Anything,” “Call Me Back,” this album’s first single “At the Door”).And then there are the proggy, metallic experiments that Casablancas now seems content to channel through Voidz, a project he has plainly admitted is where his passion lies.Historically, neither mode has led to anyone’s favorite Strokes songs.And so the best moments on The New Abnormal, like the genuinely pretty “Ode to the Mets,” feel like a step in the right direction.When everything locks into place, it’s like watching an old pinball machine light up, one level at a time.Another small victory is that Casablancas’ falsetto has improved.What once felt like a novelty (at best) actually leads to some striking moments.The verses of “Eternal Summer” are sleek and exciting—that is, until the unfortunate Austin Powers impression of a bridge waltzes in to kill everyone’s buzz.“The Adults Are Talking,” with its steady build and soaring climax, adds to their legacy of great album openers.After his distracted performances on Angles and Comedown Machine , Casablancas now sounds tasked with keeping spirits light; from the slurred Sinatra croon in “Not the Same Anymore” to his pop-punk sneer in “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus,” he seems up for the challenge.But the spark fades quickly, and you’re left with a set of promising ideas for Strokes songs with their fire stomped out.Casablancas has spoken about a politicized edge to his recent lyrics, but his allusions to the climate crisis (“Eternal Summer”) and body-shaming (“Selfless”) fail to inspire much urgency in his bandmates.And while their trademark fuzz once made their albums sound like well-loved mixtapes handed down through the decades, the same quality now makes you feel like they’re piecing together scraps.Disjointed songs like “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus” and “Selfless” literally grind to a halt and start over after each chorus, like they tried to figure out a better transition and then just gave up.“You’re not the same anymore/Don’t want to play that game anymore,” Casablancas sings in a ballad near the end of the album.And why should he?No band deserves to be held to the standard they set in their twenties, and no fan should want to hear their heroes rehash old poses for a quick paycheck.The current democratic nature of the Strokes (the music is credited to “The Strokes,” while the first three records were credited exclusively to Casablancas) means that simply bringing ideas to fruition requires more compromise—that is to say, more work.It also means that a band who should be settling into their legacy is still suffering from growing pains.“There was never a feeling of: we fucking made it!Roll credits!”, Albert Hammond Jr. recently confessed about their rise to fame.“It was always this kind of half-anxious, half-exciting ‘What the hell is happening?’” For all its faults, The New Abnormal might capture how the Strokes are feeling: not ready to fade out, not primed for a comeback.Right now, they’re just way too tired.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for The Strokes',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Nick Hakim ’s compulsively listenable debut album, 2017’s Green Twins , drew from Curtis Mayfield and D’Angelo while adding twists of beat music and psychedelia.His follow-up, WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD, stirs some Parliament/Funkadelic and Sly and the Family Stone into the mix, but the result may frustrate his fans.This time around, Hakim’s tracks are shapeless, often listless, building tension only to let it ebb away.The new record doesn’t just reward close attention; it barely exists without it.Hakim has said that “If I really sink into a recording, I don’t want it to end.” It feels safe to say that he sank into most of the recordings on Will This Make Me Good, and the result can feel endless.But there are many worthwhile moments here, even if they’re blunted by an exhausting run time.WTMMG is definitively a headphone record, and it reveals itself slowly, sometimes on an instrument-by-instrument basis.The drums on “ Qadir ,” Hakim’s gorgeous lament for a friend who died at the age of 25, steal up on you; they’re fairly wonderful.The guitar chords on “All These Instruments” are catchy.In the opening of “Bouncing,” a bassline and a chorus of spectral voices come together and combust in a moment of excitement.Listening to the record becomes an exercise in prying its many beautiful moments from their duller surroundings.“Crumpy,” buried in the album’s back half, is its strongest song, and it’s not a coincidence that it sounds a lot like the tracks on Green Twins.(Hakim said in an Instagram post that it was recorded sometime between 2017 and 2018.)It is, more than anything else here, a song, and its opening lines have more character than anything on the record: “This town has really started to grow on me/My face has become one with the concrete.” In a gesture that expresses a fundamental reluctance at the core of this album, the lyrics on the title track, a meditation on morality and radicalism that should be one of the more compelling songs here, are distorted and difficult to hear.In a tweet announcing the album , Hakim appended a note that explained a little bit more about its origin.He said that he had been experiencing writer’s block, but that the blockage had been “a build-up to the three months of expression that led to this album.” Still, he confessed, he was “still trying to figure this record out.People have told me that it’s confusing or it’s messy—that’s fine.” Credit Hakim for his self-awareness and his candor.But the people who told him that were right.WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD has plenty of gorgeous moments.Those moments will inspire the most generous listeners to wonder what this record could have been, if Hakim had given it more time to gestate, and maybe edited himself more.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)More Reviews for Nick Hakim',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Grief casts a shadow over the past.It lends new meaning to old photographs, text messages, and inside jokes, all indelibly colored by loss.On I’m Glad It’s You’s Every Sun, Every Moon, grief leads the Redlands, California band to revisit lyrics and song titles from their 2016 album The Things I Never Say.It was while touring that record, in 2017, that a van accident killed the band’s concert videographer and close friend Chris Avis.I’m Glad It’s You canceled the remainder of their tour; it would be another year before the group performed together in full and began the process of recording a new record.Every Sun, Every Moon is a lustrous document of that healing, casting the aftermath of shared pain in radiant piano and synths.The first words sung on Every Sun, Every Moon call back to the band’s first full-length: “Another long last look from the back of the ambulance,” frontman Kelley Bader croons on “Big Sound,” echoing a memorable line (“Take a long last look”) from 2016’s “Curbside.” But where once he sounded decidedly resigned, almost sighing, here his delivery is remarkably full-throated, riding brightly over searing guitars and synths.Similarly, “The Things I Never Said” casts a regretful glance back at The Things I Never Say, the title of their debut, the song’s introspection bolstered by piano interludes and surf-pop vocal harmonies.More than just Easter eggs, these references highlight the contrasts between then and now.It’s as if, spurred by the experience of unspeakable tragedy, the only way to return is louder.The album’s more mature palette was honed with the help of veteran producer J. Robbins.The former Jawbox frontman has spent the past three decades elevating scores of sheepish, shrugging bands to new melodic heights, leaving a legacy of adventurous, potent emo in his wake.The album is full of allusions to his highlights reel: The dense guitars that swirl around “Ordinary Pain” recall the Promise Ring ’s classic Nothing Feels Good ; the chiming chords on “Lost My Voice” bring to mind his work with Midwestern stalwarts Braid .Robbins’ direction suits the band, who had previously experimented with electronics on a “Redux” version of their 2016 record.Here, drawing on his experience producing similarly ambitious artists, he chooses studio techniques designed to flesh out the record’s narrative.On “The Silver Cord,” ethereal synths complement the song’s vision of a visitation from the afterlife; on “Death Is Close,” a fluttering Mellotron sets an appropriately elegiac tone.In his diverse palette, Robbins reinforces the many moods the band traces throughout the record.Robbins’ production also serves as a welcome, weighted counterbalance to Bader’s writing, which leans on metaphorical imagery to describe the complex mechanisms of mourning.After that early, ominous reference to an ambulance, the focus turns to the more ambiguous, amorphous project of healing.Often, Bader leans on his Christian upbringing; this comes to a head on “Lazarus,” which pits the Biblical miracle of rebirth against the permanence of death.“The second coming savior running late this time and now I think I see/What Lazarus taught me,” he sings meekly, the ache in his voice burnished by smoldering guitars.As opposed to the tinny, bare-bones production of their prior EPs, the song’s textured facade takes note from British shoegaze, couching dark, nihilistic topics within a thick, protective coating of distortion.But where a Christian metal band, or emo peers like Reliant K, might find solace in God, Bader eschews facile resolutions.“Myths,” despite its repetitions of “hallelujah,” finds an easy savior not in prayer, but in the glacial passage of time: “Someday soon the day is going to come,” he pleads, his voice picking up as the drums kick in.It’s an ambitious song, not only for its plaintive piano arpeggios and liquid, reverb-heavy guitar, but for the careful, slanted rhythms in its verses: “My flickering flame/Dancing for rain that doesn’t pour.” The rhymes come unexpectedly, a destabilizing effect that forces a close listen and mimics the uncertainty of grief.“It’s a hallelujah/And I’m learning how to sing” might not be the typical shout-along chorus that I’m Glad It’s You expected to write when they first set out on the road three years ago.But through trauma, they’ve landed on the profoundly triumphant note that so many emo bands spend their careers angling to reach.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)10 to Hear Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week Sign Up Now',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Last December, Moses Sumney debuted a video for a love song called “ Polly ” from his newly announced double album græ.It was about as unadorned a video treatment as possible: Sitting in front of his computer’s camera in a black t-shirt, framed by a white wall and some guitars, Sumney stared into our eyes while the song played.He did not lip sync as usual.Instead, he took a few deep breaths and began to weep, tears running down his cheeks.Every so often he gulped for air, but otherwise he remained still, and he never broke eye contact.Halfway through the song, he brushed his tears with his palm, a radiant smile escaping, his eyes warming.As the song played, its chorus stripping back longing to its pulsing root—\"see see see see me\"—he seemed to pass through something elemental and emerge on the other side, transfigured.This facility for naked emotional connection is a kind of superpower, for good or ill, and Sumney has wielded his with grace.It’s the most significant of his many, many gifts, including his astonishing singing voice, which can plead like Prince or ascend to ANOHNI or Thom Yorke heights.He’s been overwhelming new converts ever since he opened for the R&B trio KING in 2013.He spent the next several years deciding what to do with the vast possibilities his talent afforded him.Sidestepping a cresting wave of industry attention better known for ruining careers than starting them, he waited until 2017 to release his starlit debut Aromanticism on the indie label Jagjaguwar.That album, though decked in swirling string and horn arrangements, was quiet, intimate, and burned with the intensity of a few glowing embers.The most significant element in the mix, after his voice, was silence.He seemed at rest, drawing in one great breath and waiting for the moment to exhale.There was more to come, the album hinted, more to say, but not yet.On græ, he lets out everything inside of him.The album is bigger, in every sense—longer, for starters, a 20-song double album that Sumney saw fit to release in two parts (the first half of the album appeared in February, the second arriving only this week.)Where Aromanticism was intimate and sleek, græ is rangy, sprawling, a riot of moods from lustful to angry to broken-hearted.He has summoned a battalion of collaborators, including production from Daniel Lopatin , basslines from Thundercat , saxophone from Shabaka Hutchings , horn parts from the English art-rock group Adult Jazz , writing credits from James Blake and author Michael Chabon.The camera lens zooms out from dewdrop to mountain range.Everything Sumney’s ever done or tried to do is here.“Virile,” the single that preceded “Polly,” is in many ways more representative of the album’s omnivorous ambition.In the video, Sumney convulses across the fog-swirled floor of a meat locker, his body as flawless as a marble statue while carcasses swing behind him on hooks.The lyrics are a withering send-up of the pointlessness of toxic masculinity in a world where the body inevitably turns “to dust and matter.” “Cheers to the patriarchs,” he sings bitterly over bludgeoning stabs of guitar from Noah Kardos-Fein of the NYC noise-rock duo Yvette and string arrangements from Rob Moose.Like Perfume Genius ’ Mike Hadreas, Sumney mingles the cerebral and the carnal, eroticism and disgust, until the sensations are indistinguishable.He also shares Hadreas’ yearning to escape his own shell.On “Gagarin,” which interpolates a piece by the late Swedish pianist Esbjorn Svensson, Sumney sings in a pitched-down voice of wanting to “surrender my life to something bigger than me.” (The title is a likely reference to the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel to outer space.)Sumney\\'s voice pours like tar onto the sound of a jazz piano and eventually the whole track turns ectoplasmic.The final minute sounds like the birth of a universe, with synths streaking like stardust before melting down amid the formless cries of Sumney’s digitally altered voice.The HD sheen of the mix—you can practically see the air tremble around the cymbal splashes—is a bold contrast with the formless abstraction of the music, like a private-press 1970s new age record remastered by Dr. Dre .Though he might not harbor their commercial aspirations, Sumney shares some of the precision and remove of auteur figures like Dre or Trent Reznor .He controls every aspect of his art, from his flyers to the art direction of his videos, and so his music arrives seemingly whole and untouched from a different universe.It also means his work can feel a little cool to the touch, even when his lyrics are strictly autobiographical (“I had two dogs in 2004” is a good representative lyric).His voice is an instrument of pure beauty, a falsetto so dazzling he could trace a cathedral with one syllable.It also tends to turn his words into color, mere vehicles for him to cast light and shadow against the wall.The music is gorgeous, an empty word that often points to the missing thing in Sumney’s work: The stray hair, the smudged line, the wrinkle on the outfit that proved somebody once wore it.Running through the album are the sampled vocals of the Nigerian-Ghanaian author Taiye Selasi, whose ruminations on multiplicity and identity glue together the album’s edges.“I really do insist that others recognize my inherent multiplicity, Selasi says on “also also also and and and.” “What I no longer do is take pains to explain it or defend.” The dreamy piece culminates in a manifesto of sorts: “I am aware of my multiplicity, and anyone wishing to meaningfully engage with me or my work must be, too.” These pieces probe the album’s underlying consideration: How to account for your whole self, not just the pieces that you feel comfortable offering to others.For Sumney, the most precious commodity is space—space to test out your voice when no one else hears it, space to struggle your way towards self-definition.Despite his emotional transparency, Sumney seems a little ambivalent about unbridled self-expression: “Bystander” is a wry ode to the wisdom of keeping your mouth shut.“Honesty is the most moral way/But morality is grey,” he observes, in one of the album’s most tenderly sung lines.The most powerful moments on græ examine the distance between this wariness and the loneliness it produces.“I am not at peace with dying alone/But I am not at war either,” he sings on “Neither/Nor,” a negation that might be Sumney’s most resounding statement of self.His music is unique in the chilly way it yearns for warmth; he can often be coy, flirtatious, beseeching.“Sometimes I want to kiss my friends/You don’t want that…do ya?/You just want someone to listen to ya/Who ain’t tryna screw ya,” he croons on “In Bloom.” The stacked harmony vocals bear down on the line “Sometimes I want to kiss my friends,” and it proves as indelible, and maybe more meaningful, than his ideas about patriarchy or creative sovereignty.For all of græ’s high points, for all the elasticity of its ambition, Sumney’s most exalted work still happens at the emotional distance of the “Polly” video.“Polly,” like all of Sumney’s most devastating and resonant music, exists only by the grace of his calloused hands fingerpicking a simple pattern and his voice, which does more to generate cosmos than all the prodigious talents on græ combined.The album highlights—lullabies like “Lucky Me” or “Me In 20 Years”— come from a place where Sumney often finds himself: his glittering voice, resplendent and alone, aching in solitude.This is the range of the coffeehouse whisper, his hand atop yours on the table.This is still where we feel him most.Listen to our Best New Music playlist on

              " 'Pinterest On his 15th album, Damien Jurado confronts impermanence with arresting frankness.Across What’s New, Tomboy?’s 10 songs, a close friend perishes onstage, a plane smashes into the side of a mountain, and a long sought-after romance promises a dark comfort: someone to die with.Jurado may examine the unpleasant, but his observations are aren’t needlessly morbid or cynical, nor tortured or overwrought.Instead, Jurado allows these reflections to drift by like a steady current, never lingering long enough to invite undue scrutiny.In this 30-minute collection of vivid impressions, Jurado positions his voice at the front of the mix, braced by subtle and warm folk arrangements.His words are still just above a whisper, but they’re impactful as ever.What’s New, Tomboy?is, unsurprisingly, a quiet album, but it is noticeably less quiet than its predecessor, 2019’s In the Shape of a Storm , which also featured 10 brief entries.But while those songs were built entirely around acoustic guitar and Jurado’s tempered chest voice, What’s New, Tomboy?features an expanded palette courtesy of multi-instrumentalist Josh Gordon.Gordon was present on In the Shape of a Storm (playing high-strung guitar ), but here he lays down bass, electric guitar, drums, Hammond organ, Rhodes, and more.Jurado extends himself as well, adding Mellotron and percussion to his usual repertoire.The effect is hushed but rich, and Gordon’s presence adds levity to Jurado’s melodies: His guitar licks on “Arthur Aware” and opener “ Birds Tricked Into the Trees ” twinkle as they refract off Jurado’s dusky voice.Gordon might be the reason that What’s New, Tomboy?at times sounds like a stripped-back pop record.Jurado recently admitted to Aquarium Drunkard that in the past year he’s become a first-time Beatles fan (“at 47 years old!”), suggesting that this may have partly influenced the simple structure of these new songs; there’s also a McCartneyesque feel to Gordon’s basslines.But despite What’s New, Tomboy?’s enlivened arrangements, the most interesting element is his lyrics, packed with fragments of daily life and ruminations on death.Mid-album ballad “Fool Maria” relays a series of contradictory images, at first lovely and then tragic.He likens a woman’s eyelids to a closing curtain “that lets you know it’s over.” “We are fiction as it’s written/The bleeding ink on paper,” Jurado sings, accenting his words with fingerpicked guitar.“Quiet as an aeroplane/Before it hits the mountain.” It’s like Jurado has baked a fish into a birthday cake—you eat a forkful of something sweet only to bite into a pungent and unpleasant surprise.Jurado doesn’t have a regimented writing schedule; his songs show up when he’s occupied with other things, whether that’s laundry, television, or even sleep.Avoiding the process is the process, and it’s likely the reason his lyrics sound so inspired and original.On the driving “Arthur Aware,” banshee-like backing vocals swirl around the dark fable, and a character named Mr. Will shares a cryptic secret: “I keep all of my prized reflections/In glass jars from the coroner,” he says.“And when I get bored of looking at myself/I trade the gray for the shade of someone else.” Singular passages like this are marbled throughout the album, and they don’t sound like belabored phrases that have been erased and rewritten a thousand times.Instead, they seem to have appeared to Jurado fully formed while he was walking through the grocery store—slippery thoughts that will dissolve if not documented immediately.If Jurado’s ideas are fleeting and intangible, that might be because he thinks life is, too.On “Ochoa,” Jurado sings to his late friend and longtime collaborator Richard Swift , who died in 2018 of complications from alcohol addiction.“Absence tunes the choir/Symphonies of you,” Jurado sings, again disrupting a serene image with a death knell: “You turn to sing, you’re gone/The show must go on.” But Jurado is quick to comfort his lost friend with the knowledge that he won’t be long behind.This sentiment is reinforced on “The End of the Road,” perhaps the album’s best song.Here death is lassoed to devotion.Gordon’s walking, bulbous bassline guides Jurado and his partner down a winding one-way street.We all know what’s at the end of it, but Jurado makes time to take in the bewildering scenery along the way.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest With their radiant warmth and cracked, spidery riffs, Chicago jangle-rock band Cafe Racer sound a bit like a sidewalk on a summer day.For a while, they seemed perfectly content to stroll: On their second album, 2018’s Famous Dust , they shuffled along at a leisurely pace, guided by singer Michael Santana’s staticky whisper-sneer.It was a vibe, but the songs didn’t always move with confidence—some had one chord change too many, one true change too few.Their third album, Shadow Talk, doesn’t just leave those critiques in the dust—it’s also the rare case of a band that sounds entirely aware of how much better it’s gotten.Cafe Racer are now bigger, sharper, and far more flexible.While Santana still sings as though from behind Jim Reid ’s and Jason Pierce ’s sunglasses, he also doesn’t hesitate to tear them off for the occasional towering ripper and bark some heavy-sounding words, pushing his full weight into “boulder” and “vulture” on “Seminal Art.” Behind him, bassist Rob McWilliams and new drummer Elise Poirier hum in the shadows.They do heavy lifting without breaking a sweat; when the rest of the band violently crashes down around them in the middle third of “Exile,” they keep the whole thing up while hardly raising their voices.Still, the best part of Shadow Talk is its gestalt: The individual pieces are all a notch stronger, but their sum is a ton stronger.Credit not only Cafe Racer’s conviction to rewire their love of fuzz with new energy, but also the album’s phenomenal sequencing.Subtle but firm, Shadow Talk’s motion mirrors time and weather: the first three tracks sound like a lucid morning becoming a focused afternoon, then gliding into a depressurized evening.Midway through the 10-minute closing track, a sustaining organ slips in unannounced, the whistling breeze that gently informs you that you have about four minutes before it turns into a droning downpour.Shadow Talk is soluble yet rock-solid; it evaporates and re-materializes with ease.For a five-piece like Cafe Racer, grasping this slippery balance doesn’t happen by accident.It can take years of trial and error, the kind of long-term conditioning made possible by the independent venues where the band came up—venues that suddenly find themselves endangered .Shadow Talk is a victory made possible in part by artistic incubators like the Hideout , the Empty Bottle , and Beat Kitchen ; it’s heavy but fitting that the album now takes on additional meaning advocating for their survival.10 to Hear Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week Sign Up Now',\n",
              " 'Pinterest As much as any American band, Chicano Batman represents the diversity of the American experience, the idea that no one thing exclusively belongs to any one group of people.A group of Latinos from Southern California with Central, North, and South American heritage, they grew up listening to as much Ruben Blades and Rigo Tovar as Dr. Dre and Warren G .For the past decade, they’ve honed a distinctly American take on Tropicália’s sun-drenched psychedelic grooves, evolving from the meandering jams of their eponymous debut to tightly crafted psych-funk jams with a political bent.It’s this perspective that shapes their fourth LP, Invisible People.The album’s thesis—“…a statement of hope, a proclamation that we are all invisible people, and that despite race, class, or gender we can overcome our differences and stand together”—is admittedly a bit hokey, but the songs themselves speak with considerably more nuance and wit, decrying “prophets for profit” and reminding us that race is a construct.The record’s optimism is rooted in love, the subject of most of its songs, and in its rhythm section, which makes even the most macabre tracks danceable.Because while the band has long responded to the contemporary political climate—2017’s Freedom Is Free is a direct response to the idea that it isn’t—they come from a place of perseverance, a dogged resistance to succumbing to the forces of evil.To that end, Chicano Batman songs typically start with a vibe, the pursuit of a specific feeling.Album opener “Color my Life” grew from a desire to make a song like Queen’s “Cool Cat” that boogied like Parliament.The demo for “Pink Elephant,” a song ostensibly about a predatory woman, was originally named “$40 Car Wash,” for the swagger that bassist Eduardo Arenas felt after getting an expensive car wash on his birthday.The result is a mish-mash of the ’90s hip-hop and R&B of their youth; think Ginuwine singing a D’Angelo song from a lowrider in a Warren G music video.With Chicanos.It’s a lot of fun.But Invisible People is at its strongest when it gets confrontational.On the title track,  Bardo Martinez’s croon bleeds all over the hook, and the verses plainly state axioms that only sound radical to those privileged by the status quo: “Invisible people, the truth is we’re all the same/The concept of race was implanted inside your brain….Invisible people, the truth is we take the blame/Fuck the system, it created so much pain.” It’s followed by “Manuel’s Story,” a frantic jaunt of a song driven by a spacey synth melody that belies its bleak narrative, which tells of an uncle who fled cartel violence to live in the U.S. It’s a vignette that distills the collateral damage of America’s drug war and Mexican immigration, a reminder of the people rendered invisible by capitalist political forces.Or maybe it’s just a tall tale your drunk tío likes to tell at the cookout.Whether it actually happened is mostly irrelevant.The 2020 version of Chicano Batman has evolved from its original incarnation.The influences that shaped them are still present, but their perspective has shifted; this is the first Chicano Batman LP without a word of Spanish.They’ve ditched their most distinctive visual elements, like the wedding-band-chic of their matching ruffled suits—an homage to Latin ballad groups of the ’60s and ’70s—as well as Bardo’s shoulder-length mane.But while they may have shed some of the quirks that made them unique, Invisible People is far and away Chicano Batman’s most accessible record, with big, clean hooks to match definitive statements.A decade into writing songs together, they sound stronger than ever.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)10 to Hear Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week Sign Up Now',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Madeline Johnston, the slowcore multi-instrumentalist who records as Midwife and Sister Grotto, found her footing as an artist while living at Rhincoeropolis, a beloved warehouse venue and artist co-op in Denver, Colorado.When local officials shuttered the space in the wake of the 2016 Oakland Ghost Ship fire , Johnston and her close friend Colin Ward were two of 15 local musicians displaced.A little over a year later, Ward died unexpectedly.The back-to-back losses left Johnston feeling suffocated by sorrow, disconnected from her community in a city that no longer felt like home.She immersed herself in the songwriting process until she resurfaced with Forever, a collection of candid, minimalist shoegaze that grapples with the impermanence of life.With the barren dream-pop of album opener “2018,” she surveys the year and forces herself to accept the truth, repeating, “This is really happening” until the words go numb.There’s always been an air of detachment to Midwife’s music—2017’s Like Author, Like Daughter sounds like anesthetized Grouper—but here she sounds trapped, stuck in the purgatory of grief.On lead single “Anyone Can Play Guitar,” which sounds nothing like the Radiohead song , a hazy wash of guitar floods the air as she lies flat on her back, fixated on the desire to outrun her life yet pinned beneath the minute hand of a clock.It’s the type of warm, melancholic drone you want to pull up to your chin like a weighted blanket, and she wisely follows it with “Vow,” a heartbreaking instrumental that spaces out its lone piano chords so each one falls like a teardrop.Midwife is the rare artist who can wallow in pain without indulging self-pity.She performs her own kind of therapeutic practice on “C.R.F.W.,” a nearly nine-minute sprawl that opens with a recording of Ward reading an original poem about desire and fate, originally commissioned for the 2011 collaborative project Pure Becoming .His recitation is empathetic, spiritual, spoken in a flat tone with no audience in mind.In the final line, he compares death to a falling leaf: “Imagine the way a breeze feels against your leaf body when you finally don’t have to hold on anymore.” It’s not the poem itself that’s so remarkable, but the way Midwife follows his words with ambient drone and tectonic synth hums, turning it into a moving homage that feels like a hypnagogic meditation on the possibility of an afterlife.Johnston calls her music “heaven metal,” and Forever is heavy and hypnotic, full of nearly wordless ruminations on the pain of loss.But while the album begins as an outlet for grief, it grows towards zen-like acceptance of death.Closer “S.W.I.M.” capitalizes on Midwife’s strengths—blown-out fuzz, lethargic percussion, a pop of melody that appears like a daydream—to mirror her lyrics: “Treading water my whole life/I don’t want to swim forever/Reaching for the other side.” Forever is first and foremost a tribute to Ward, but its strength lies in the power of Johnston’s singular experience to unlock communal knowledge: that the mourning process never really becomes less painful, but so long as it’s inevitable, we need not feel alone.More Reviews for Midwife',\n",
              " 'Pinterest The unsubtle party drug nod, which now scans as very 10 years ago, was never the point.As Pure X guitarist/vocalist Nate Grace told Dummy in 2013, “Pleasure, ecstasy, purity—those ideas are directly related to the act of making music.” And, in the same interview, “You can’t experience pleasure without feeling pain, you cannot know ecstasy without knowing despair.” Pure X, the Austin band’s first album since 2014’s Angel , still jives with Grace’s earlier concept, in which ecstasy isn’t so much the result of listening to the music as a distant, unattainable goal or state of being.But in the six years since Angel, Grace, bassist/vocalist Jesse Jenkins V, drummer Austin Youngblood, and multi-instrumentalist Matty Tommy Davidson have further clarified their sound, creating the brightest and tightest bummer jams of their career.Album opener “Middle America” sets the scene: “Send help, I’m stranded in Middle America,” sings Grace from a Bible Belt hell they can’t escape.“Send help, I’m losing sense of who I am.” The rest of the record wrestles with finding meaning in a turbulent world, in a country where happiness—let alone ecstasy—is hard to come by.The lyrics offer flashes of beauty between the crush of the everyday.“All the neon skies are going grey,” Jenkins sings on “Fantasy.” “My people work so hard and work so long/Break and fall and disappear.” These are tunes for our times, but also seem built for age-old pursuits: nursing sweaty beers, driving through the Texas desert, diving into a swimming hole.Pure X arrives in a landscape at once parallel and vastly different from the climate of the band’s soporific first singles.Back in 2009, the recession had wildly altered the prospects of many young people.Careers were put on hold, replaced by Tecate-and-pot-filled warehouses and a DIY sensibility that lived as much on the internet as it did in clubs or practice spaces.“The first time we got on Pitchfork, I think they linked to my MySpace,” Grace told The Austin Chronicle .Much of Pure X is reminiscent of the working-class indie rock of the ’90s, when shit jobs and encroaching suburbia represented an existential threat to bands like Modest Mouse and Built to Spill .Economic uncertainty pokes out between otherwise metaphorical lyrics about relationships and personal growth.“I can’t afford the future/I don’t know my past,” sings Grace on “Making History.” “We’ve been working for nothing for so long.” Though these slice-of-life musings are sometimes dire, a feeling of patience and acceptance permeates Pure X’s 12 tracks.“I forgive myself for how I hurt myself,” goes one line in “Hollywood.” As with much of the band’s output, the music was recorded live—this time at Good Danny’s Studio in Lockhart, Texas—and carries with it a polished immediacy.Earlier in their career, Pure X had a tendency to muddy Grace and Jenkins’ voices, creating the impression they were singing from inside a hollow or behind a veil.But on Pure X, their deliveries ring clear, timbres unadulterated by fuzz or distortion.The album’s guitars, too, are more pristine, tinged with Americana or imbued with a psychedelic shimmer.Pure X’s druggy, wall-of-sound escapism put them on the map in their early days, but they sound more confident without it.On previous records, the band sometimes used synths to fill gaps between instruments, lending their sound density and heaviness.They’ve been gradually cleaning up their approach since 2013’s Crawling Up the Stairs , but on Pure X, they do more than wipe away the cobwebs; they take a Dyson to them.Bass, drums, and guitar give these songs a sparer, more intentional character.Across the album, hints of ’60s folk and lustrous ’70s rock are easy to spot.“How Good Does It Get” has a surf-rock shimmer—“How deep does love go?” wonders Grace—while “Grieving Song” matches elegiac lyrics with doleful guitars, a zombie doing the Zombies .After Angel, it was unclear if Pure X would stay together.The band members had migrated across the region, even started families.Pure X focuses less on that period of upheaval and more on the feeling of moving past it, wisened and ready for what’s next.Eleven years into their career, the smoke has cleared, leaving that age-old enemy of youth: perspective.But chasing pure ecstasy remains a lifelong pursuit of pyrrhic victory.“I can dream,” sings Davidson on the album closer.“I can dream.” (Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest In a 2000 interview with Melody Maker , Elliott Smith told a story from his childhood.He is three years old—Steven Paul Smith, born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1969—and he is messing around with his mother’s television set.Immediately, he is transfixed by the power of the remote control: This button makes the sound burst from the speaker and this one silences it.This button makes the screen change, each time reopening to a new world, while this one shuts it off entirely.It’s a lot of power for a child.He is delighted by the collage of faces and voices and sound and possibility until the inevitable happens: the TV breaks.He soon learned to seek the same thrill in music.Smith’s first love was the Beatles , a band whose career lasted less than 10 years, so their every move carried immense weight and meaning for those discovering it in retrospect.His favorite song was the multi-part “ A Day in the Life ,” which he might have heard like a television constantly changing channels, each one landing on the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.When he started writing his own music, he followed this blueprint, accidentally stumbling upon the avant-garde.He described his earliest compositions as more like transitions than actual songs; as he reflected to Under the Radar in one of his last interviews, he didn’t understand why every part couldn’t be the best part.From Omaha, Smith and his mother moved to Dallas.He left as a teenager, a decision he attributed to a town full of bullies and an abusive step-father.His next stops were Portland, Oregon, where he lived with his father—a preacher turned Air Force pilot turned psychiatrist—and Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts.At college, Smith studied political science and philosophy and was so affected by feminist texts that he momentarily wanted to become a fireman to offset some of the damage he did to the world simply by being a straight white man.He also met like-minded artists, including classmate Neil Gust, who helped him feel useful in a different way—trading punk 7\"s and collaborating on music.After graduation, Gust and Smith returned to Portland, where they formed the grungy alt-rock band Heatmiser.The rise of Smith’s spare, self-recorded solo material and Heatmiser’s blistering rock songs are often held in contrast.But the truth is his solo work bloomed alongside their music, which had softened and matured by 1996’s extraordinary swansong Mic City Sons.So while Smith hated straining his voice to be heard over the noise (“I’ve had enough of people yelling,” he told Rolling Stone ) and the way their audience reminded him of the dudes who gave him hell back in Texas, it did bring him closer to the sound he heard in his head.Rock music was always Smith’s guiding light.When interviewers compared him to folk singers like Paul Simon or Nick Drake , you could feel his eyes roll into his head.And when it came time to flesh out his solo sets with cover songs, he turned to rock radio staples: the Beatles, Led Zeppelin , the Kinks .He felt a particular kindred spirit with Big Star , the cult band whose 1972 ballad “ Thirteen ” would become a standard in his hands.The initial connection wasn’t because of their hard-luck story or the unspeakable loneliness of records like Third.Instead, Smith admired how Alex Chilton and the band rallied for a style of music that was unfashionable in their scene, following their intuition as opposed to trends.So just as Big Star performed their charging take on British Invasion power-pop to half-empty rooms through Memphis, Smith abandoned his Portland alt-rock band—their growing acclaim, their major label deal, their “next Nirvana” buzz—to strike out on his own.Released while Heatmiser was still gaining momentum, his 1994 solo debut Roman Candle was less a complete statement than a collection of demos, compiled in the hopes that a label would pick the best songs for a 7\" single.The following year’s Elliott Smith, then, can be seen as his first official solo album, issued on the buzzy indie label Kill Rock Stars.Like Roman Candle, it was recorded in the homes of friends—Heatmiser drummer Tony Lash and Leslie Uppinghouse, who toured with the band and mixed their live sound.Uppinghouse remembers setting Smith up in her basement, off in the corner with an eight-track Tascam tape recorder.Her dog, Anna, would sometimes press her nose against the door to listen in.Uppinghouse claims she can hear her in a few songs.Smith described a preference for writing distractedly—at crowded bars, at home watching Xena: Warrior Princess, anywhere he could take his mind off the idea of being a serious songwriter doing serious work.But he was devoted to his process.He wrote and recorded constantly, in a stream of interconnected ideas.The 12 songs he selected for Elliott Smith reflect that spirit.Phrases and images reoccur.The theme of addiction is constant, and his euphemisms are abundant and clear: white lady, white brother, death in your arms, getting good marks.His tone is often resigned, the perspective of someone who sees what’s going on but knows better than to fight.In the bridge of “Alphabet Town,” he sings, “I know what you are/I just don’t mind.” The chorus of “Good to Go” distills it even further: “You can do it if you want to.” Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest The song titles on Retirement Party ’s second album read like a checklist of responsibilities on the path to maturity, each a bit more dispiriting than the last: “Runaway Dog,” “Compensation,” “Old Age.” By the time we reach “I Wonder if They Remember You,” it can be hard to recall that the band’s primary lyricist, Avery Springer, is barely out of college.But even on their debut LP, 2018’s Somewhat Literate, adult obligations loomed in the background, anxieties spurred by the expectations that set in when college finals give way to job applications.The standout song on that record, the blown-out “Passion Fruit Tea,” offered jamming with friends as a respite to the drudgery of work.But two years later, having graduated with a degree in music business, Springer has an understandably more jaded outlook.Her newfound angst is palpable on Runaway Dog, channeled via slick, outsized refrains.Runaway Dog pursues a more atmospheric and anthemic sound than Retirement Party’s debut, one that doesn’t lean on an onslaught of immediate hooks.This might be a result of the record’s more collaborative process, with drummer James Ringness and bassist/guitarist Eddy Rodriguez providing input from the beginning, rather than simply coming in to record Springer’s fully conceived songs.The resulting melodies are more patient, their progressions more meandering and less obvious.On “Fire Blanket,” which opens with distorted power chords punctuated by blasts from the drums, it takes almost 30 seconds for Springer to start singing; for a band whose biggest singles previously featured her voice within the first beat or two, it’s a sign of restraint.A gleaming new guitar melody introduced in the second verse propels the song to the final refrain with a newfound polish.The same is true of the title track, which opens with a galloping rhythm guitar; drums don’t enter the picture until nearly a minute in.That deferral—building up the song in layers, stacking two verses before anything resembling a chorus—creates a tension that was missing from their previous releases.Trusting that the audience will stay beyond the hook is a bold choice; executing it so confidently from the first track shows a band eager to transcend pop-punk expectations.They take risks with songwriting structure as well, with opening lines often beginning somewhat in medias res; on “Compensation,” Springer drops us into an unfiltered lamentation: “Oh when the quality’s poor, how can you sell a feeling/Without unethical means of promotion?” It’s a rapid-fire mouthful, syllables stretched to fit the rhythm guitar, a rambling tactic that seems designed to blunt the force of her criticisms.But lest the song sound like pop punk by way of Slint , the band lands on a shout-along chorus that’s just abstracted enough to speak to generalized anxieties: “I’ll always know to look both ways before I cross the road/If I get hit all that means is compensation.” In context, it’s a bleak evaluation of the current state of the industry, and a line that establishes what Retirement Party do best: cheeky mixed metaphors, often pulling from childhood lessons, that point out the ironies of adulthood.Verbosity is a standard trope of emo songwriting, one Retirement Party deploy frequently to lend a sense of breathless anxiety to ostensibly cheery instrumentation.But where Springer’s rushed delivery on Somewhat Literate was charmingly dizzying, impressive in its tight enunciation over whip-fast guitars, that approach falters when the band takes its time.With each word painstakingly drawn out, the sheer syllabic effort on slower tracks like “Old Age” and “Afterthought” sounds taxing, as if she’s fatigued by so many vowel sounds.On a record only 10 songs long, the odd vocal crack or awkward rhyme can threaten to derail the momentum so steadily built in the first half.But the inclusion of slower songs—ballads, almost—also signals a conscious effort to avoid premature categorization.They’re an emo band from the Midwest, but they don’t have the twinkling orchestral melodies of “Midwest emo.” They sing about anxiety over power chords, but their lyrics are couched in a layer of detached poeticism that sets them apart from the frustrated, lovelorn cries of their pop-punk peers.Springer nods to the patterns expected of her band on the quiet, twangy closer “Wild Boyz”: “Write a song that they can sing along with/Make friends that you don’t even have to talk with.” It might be a recognition of the band’s current ambitions, and a confession that she wants something more.As a distorted guitar breakdown sweeps over the track like an approaching storm, we’re left with a band fit for a stadium, no matter the size of the rooms that they’re currently playing.Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest We’ll begin with the strangest song on the record: “Get the Old Band Back Together,” a jocular sing-a-long, replete with harmonica and hand claps, on a record otherwise composed of finger-picked dirges.“Let’s get the old band back together again!” Hutson sings, fronting a gleeful chorus.“Let’s get in the room and let the magic happen!” Though something very special does happen on this album, credit is due not to magic, but to Hutson’s extraordinarily talented ensemble.That’s Conor Oberst you hear on that harmonica, and Lucy Dacus and Meg Duffy in the mix, and Phoebe Bridgers at the boards.With friends like these, who needs sorcery?Christian Lee Hutson is presently best known for his collaborations with Bridgers, having co-written songs on both boygenius and Better Oblivion Community Center .Traces of his career prior to their link-up are scarce.He recorded two solo albums in the early 2010s, neither of which appears to be currently available on streaming services.In the absence of any earlier trajectory to trace, a few key questions—who this guy is, where the hell he came from, how he got so goddamn good at this—will have to go unanswered.Hutson does not seek to reinvent the wheel on “Beginners.” He offers nothing you’ve not heard before.Even his voice sounds familiar on first listen, a dead ringer in many places for the delicate timbre of Paul Simon .But Hutson’s particular variation on finger-picked folk is as refined and masterfully crafted as you’ll find anywhere.What distinguishes Beginners from any number of other, lesser albums are Hutson’s unflinching probes into human fallibility.On opener “Atheist,” Hutson shrugs at a Sunday School hymn: “It went like, ‘Angels watching over us, all our little lives’/I don’t know if I buy it, but it does sound kinda nice.” This moment sets the stage for a record which turns away from grand metaphysical questions and toward mundane manmade struggle.Whether he’s singing about outpatient rehabilitation (“Seven Lakes”), a hostile high school (“Northsiders”), or the deterioration of an intimate relationship (every other track, just about), Hutson’s focus remains the ways in which human beings can’t help but hurt one another.He’s even brave enough to cast himself as the scoundrel on a few tracks.On “Unforgivable,” when he dismisses a partner with, “I just can’t fucking do it anymore,” he slows and stresses the cruelest word, earning it like a television writer allotted only one per season.His delivery of the downright-malevolent “Keep You Down” is just as indelible.When he winces on the chorus’ high harmonies, it’s as though he feels the very pain his narrator inflicts.There is something refreshing in seeing a songwriter so mindful of his capacity for betrayal, and so effortfully working to fix the damage he’s done.“Lose This Number” is especially moving, the haughty fuck-off of its title phrase becoming a yearning plea for connection as he fondly reminisces with someone he once loved.“You don’t have to forgive me,” he sings.“Hell, you probably shouldn’t.” Hutson is at his very best when he’s not showing off.He occasionally rivals Hemingway for the amount of sheer devastation he can pack into six words.On “Talk,” taking a neglectful parent to task, he sings, “I was raised over the phone”—a damning indictment, no pretty poetry necessary.He stumbles only when he doesn’t give these moments room to breathe, as with the shocking climax of “Northsiders,” a gut-punch too quickly swallowed up by the song’s breezy schoolyard rhyme scheme.Some of his darlings, too, would be better off killed.“It’s like I was born on the back of a bullet/With your name written on it” is a lovely lyric, but out of place in the intimate late-night conversation of “Lose This Number.” This sort of adornment only distracts from the great strength of his simple language and imagery.Hutson’s musical style finds a perfect complement in Bridgers’ subtle production.She carefully seasons Hutson’s acoustic finger-picking with other instrumental layers—a tart keyboard line on “Twin Soul,” a crisp cymbal on “Lose This Number,” and buttery strings throughout—to bring out the flavor of his playing, but never overwhelm its delicacy.Another collaborator, Nathaniel Walcott of Bright Eyes, is responsible for the marvel of Beginners’ string arrangements.This record was made with friends in the room, and those friends were invariably extraordinarily talented.The starry group of back-up singers from “Get the Old Band Back Together” make a welcome return on the final number, “Single for the Summer.” There, they all repeat a single line—“It’s gonna happen any day now”—with an air of rebellious optimism and so much conviction you can’t help but believe them.We may not be guarded by angels, but human beings can make for a pretty fine choir in a pinch.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest After Ian Devaney’s first band—the polished, punk-tinged rockers Static Jacks—fell apart in the early 2010s, the singer sought comfort in recreating the synth pop of his youth.What started as a nostalgia trip would eventually morph into a proper band, expanding to include ex-Static Jack member Michael Sue-Poi and synth player Aidan Noell.The band took its time, trickling out singles piecemeal before finally releasing their debut album Introduction, Presence, four years after forming.The time put in shines through; Introduction, Presence is a remarkably self-assured debut, 10 pristine pieces of synth pop that eschew dramatics for concision.Songs like “Rush & Fever” and “On Division St” reach the glory of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and The Human League through an attention to craft that many bands with the same influences fail to notice.The album is full of miniaturized synth flourishes and clear, crisp drum beats that were probably fussed over for months until they came out just right.Sue-Poi’s bass lines are the secret weapon,  having learned Peter Hook’s lesson that the bass can be a powerful melody instrument.Despite the shimmer, Introduction, Presence is a decidedly forlorn work, haunted by the ever-present specter of past mistakes and accumulated hardship.“I’m wasting away/I took the long road home and it never paid off for me,” Devaney sings in the album opener “Tournament” in a downcast voice that echoes through the entire record.Yet while nostalgia and longing inform the album, they never consume it, and the band knows when to push forward.“Turn the pages/Try to find another way,” he sings achingly at the end of“The Motorist,” desperate to escape this moment in his life.Introduction, Presence doesn’t offer any great reinventions.Notes of Altered Images, early Depeche Mode , or even modern contemporaries like Black Marble are impossible to ignore while listening.But their understanding of the genre they’re working in—its workings, tropes, and trappings—is so refined that they are able to boil it down to its barest essence, saving catharsis for just the right moment.That moment arrives with the album’s final song, “The Wall and I.” It shines as their most anthemic cut through just a few well-placed, dramatic keyboard notes and some unexpected guitar chords.Devaney sounds just as trapped in his circumstances as he always does, but for once it feels like he might transcend them as well.“I stared up the wall and he said/‘I don’t know’ is not an answer to the question,” he wails in the chorus, realizing he can no longer hide in indecision.Not necessarily a comforting epiphany, but fitting for an album built on making peace with the past, and taking small steps to something grander.More Reviews for Nation of Language',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Does Jeff Rosenstock ever get tired of seeing the future?Basically every musical and ethical component that his previous band Bomb the Music Industry!stood for in 2005 still remain.Bigger labels have allowed him to maintain a pay-what-you-want model that predated Radiohead’s famous method of sale for their 2007 album In Rainbows and predicted the current outright reliance on tip jars and shareware .Rosenstock’s side projects variously embrace ska, folk-punk, and Long Island pop-punk, long before these profoundly uncool offshoots were finally given their due as gateways to deeper DIY engagement.But his mainstream breakthrough didn’t arrive until 2016’s WORRY., when the election of Donald Trump accelerated America’s degradation to the point where the country started to look exactly like the worst fears of New York’s most anxious punk.After 2018’s POST- emerged to audit year one of the #Resistance, NO DREAM asks: When retail therapy, mindfulness apps, and pyrrhic political engagement all fail to provide anything more than a distraction, how do we live with ourselves?It’s quintessential Jeff Rosenstock—an album formulated around evergreen sociopolitical concerns yet sounds like it could’ve been written 30 minutes ago.Once again releasing an album with no advance warning, Rosenstock gets to the point in less than a minute with “NO TIME,” a welcome reacclimation to his hardcore roots delivered with frothing intensity.It’s a different kind of urgency than the one lent to POST-, which began with a chant of “we’re tired and bored” and ended with “we’re not gonna let them win,” less an expression of defiance than exhaustion.With meaningful, large-scale political change seeming further out of reach, the only conceivable path to serenity is having the wisdom to know what internal changes are possible.“Did you turn into a person that you really want to be?” Rosenstock yells throughout “NO TIME,” at you, at the mirror, rhetorically.Perhaps other artists have expressed more high-minded or effective anger at late capitalism’s human cost, but no one is more adept at validating the helplessness that comes from being constantly activated and totally powerless.Rosenstock’s solo career almost functions as a treatise about the lie of American industrialization.Once machines relieved humans of backbreaking physical and mental labor, surely we’d have more time to dedicate to personal improvement, community organizing, arts, and culture.Instead, the distractions just became shinier and more inescapable, the ostensible freedom of working from home revealed as being your own browbeating boss 24/7.And now that the economy has cratered and many people have nothing but time for all those New Year’s resolutions and long-shelved self-improvement projects, there’s even less incentive to take them on.The righteous aims of NO DREAM are true, even if they’re at broad targets—consumerism rebranded as morality; toxic online forums; one side of the political spectrum offering increasingly emboldened cruelty while the other is “weaponizing what’s left of your empathy.” “I’ve been told most my life, ‘Try and see the other side’/By people who have never tried to see the other side,” Rosenstock mocks during “Scram!,” giving them the half-a-bar they deserve.A few months ago, “Scram!”’s central hook (“Don’t you wanna go away?”) might’ve meant signing out of Twitter or Facebook, getting more involved in a local election, or finding solace in a marathon Death Rosenstock gig .The shoutalongs of NO DREAM are potent enough for individual use, but their communal impact is now sadly theoretical.Where does anyone go now when going off the grid means almost total disconnection from society?Two years ago, Rosenstock simply bemoaned the existence of “ All This Useless Energy, ” and NO DREAM tries to figure out where it eventually ends up.Fittingly, it’s far more spiteful and aggressive than his recent endeavors into power-pop , Billy Joel piano balladry , and Neil Young covers would’ve predicted.Pretty much every song on NO DREAM ends up veering towards the raw materials of Rosenstock’s less critically revered days.“Scram!” takes a midsong trip to the House of Blues for a metalcore breakdown, while the actual skramz pop up on the title track, which spends its first two minutes lost in the dual drones of college rock jangle and an endless scroll of atrocity.In the past, this kind of genre flipping could be used as a flex; on NO DREAM, it’s the sound of the walls closing in.The second half of NO DREAM narrows its scope to Rosenstock’s life as a musician and the self-doubt, heightened expectations, and precarity that results from spending decades dedicating one’s life to something that, at most, might provide enough success to justify carrying on.Yet, it also features some of the most expansive, rich writing of his career.“Be an aging tourist/Hustle like a tortoise,” he half-jokes during “f a m e,” a jerky dance-punk throwback to a time when it was a lot easier for acts at the upper echelons of indie rock to make ends meet.From that point forward, Rosenstock can only remember the good old days in the most unromantic terms: “Pictures of toilets across the planet,” increasingly short phone calls back home, a pyramid of beer cans in a flophouse that he’s embarrassed to have made and too proud to knock down.These would be worthwhile even just as bitterly funny snapshots of a band successful enough to play to arms-crossed crowds in Germany.But as he did with WORRY.’s “ Festival Song ,” Rosenstock can zoom out just enough to see the bigger picture, specifically, his complicity in the compromises everyone needs to make in order to make late capitalism work.The verses of “***BNB” would be hilarious Airbnb host reviews if they weren’t so heartbreaking—the first is dedicated to a stranger named Sam, stuck in a dead-end job and a terrible marriage, her house secretly being rented out by her mother so guys like Rosenstock can save a few bucks on tour.Delivered in a sing-song cadence, “I used the shower sponge when you went to Spain alone” should live on as the most devastating encapsulation of the pathetic intimacy generated by platform business.Rosenstock’s previous two albums ended on notes of bleak solidarity: Perfection doesn’t exist, so let’s enjoy each other’s humanity; they’re probably going to win but we won’t just let them.NO DREAM closer “Ohio Tpke” is dedicated to “the only person I ever wanted to like me,” and it starts out like so many other love letters from the road—counting the dashes in the median on the ride home, songs shared on a summer night, a simple connection on FaceTime easing loneliness better than a room full of fans.“Ohio Tpke” morphs to embody any number of quintessentially American rock bands—Bruce Springsteen, Against Me!, Wilco, Built to Spill—and the mood shifts just as quickly, as Rosenstock recognizes how everything required to make a life on the road work at his age gets less resilient.The phone calls get shorter, the reunions get more awkward, agitated, more desperate, more definitive: “I hate coming home/I hate leaving home.” If it was written by someone who showed even the slightest bit less commitment to their craft and cause than Jeff Rosenstock, I’d take “Ohio Tpke” as a retirement announcement.NO DREAM is about what really goes on when you take enough time to think about whether you’ve turned into the person that you really wanted to be.Maybe there will be freedom from having to repeat the same cycle of releasing an album and trying to find just enough income away from home to do the same thing over again, two years older than you were before.Maybe Rosenstock writes a batch of songs about slowing down just enough to find glimmers of inner peace, or the collective disbelief when someone else is president, or the disorientating euphoria of being able to leave our houses again.But if history’s any indication, even if all of that happens, Jeff Rosenstock will write about how nothing really changed on the most prophetic album of 2022.More Reviews for Jeff Rosenstock',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Dread has been an important ingredient in Jeremy Earl’s best music.Earl, the bandleader of Woods , has a dreamy falsetto that’s offset beautifully by unsettling songs, the type that appeared all over 2009’s Songs of Shame and 2010’s At Echo Lake .Those two albums were Woods’ best, with Earl’s darker reveries nurtured by the band’s remarkably coherent music: warm, comforting psychedelic folk tinged with sadness, confusion, and mystery.Woods’ newest album, Strange to Explain, arrives almost exactly a decade after At Echo Lake and, happily, sounds very much like it, evoking a familiar Woods feeling: that of a blazing campfire surrounded by darkness.The record represents a roaring comeback for the band at a moment to which their sound is particularly well-suited.Earl was set back on his heels after the 2016 presidential election and the band’s rushed response, 2017’s Love Is Love , was insipid and gooey.At times, its saccharine lyrics could feel like parody, something written by conservatives imagining the taste of liberal tears: “How can we love if this won’t go away?How can we love with this kind of hate?” Strange to Explain doesn’t gesture helplessly in the direction of bad feeling, but leans right into it.And in acknowledging the ubiquity of pain, the album offers to help banish it.Even the lesser tracks here are not what they seem.The two-minute instrumental “The Void” opens like a standard guitar jam (with some vibraphone mixed in) and arrives at a melodic hook within 30 seconds.But the song remains in motion, running from one neighborhood to the next, with new melodies coming into view every 30 seconds or so until its climax is revealed: not that initial hook but a brass refrain that undergirds the entire thing.It’s fully realized and then it’s gone, a feeling as wistful and complex as arriving at the edge of a waterfront.If there’s a criticism to be made, it’s that many of the strongest songs here sound as if they could have come out years ago.But album highlight “Can’t Get Out,” an anthemic song that combines garage-rock rumble with Dire Straits Americana (courtesy of the Mellotron that’s all over the album), sounds wholly new and remarkably cathartic.It’s a full-throated jam that describes the feeling of suffocation even as it rejects it.The sound is muddier than Woods’ usual, and Earl is belting: “Can’t get back/Can’t get out/Can’t take a breath/Leave me be.” Woods’ lyrics have always been impressionistic, but even as the quality of the songs here ranges, certain motifs recur: night, void, dreams, immersive experiences that make sense only in the light of day, if they ever do.The spooky title track has the most interesting lyrics, with Earl asserting that “you can reinvent yourself so you don’t slip away,” suggesting, basically, that the way to avoid death is to continually kill off versions of yourself.Yet the ghosts of past selves pile up, resulting in a déjà vu that gives the song, and the record, its name.Naturally, because the subject matter is so unsettling, it’s one of the prettiest tracks on the record.It’s tempting to hear this album as an elegy for David Berman , for whom Woods served as a backing band in the months leading up to his suicide.But Strange to Explain was written and recorded before that collaboration came to full fruition.Berman’s demons may have informed Earl’s, as a recent New York Times profile about their collaboration suggested, but Woods are perfectly capable of turning their own nightmares into compelling music.Late in the album, on “Light of Day,” Earl turns his attention outward.As with “The Void,” the song takes its time revealing itself, with a bridge that feels like a hook preceding the actual chorus.The lyrics are angry, as Earl sings, “You can fill your void with an empty cup/It might tear you apart, almost every night.” His voice couldn’t sound any sweeter.(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)Most Read Reviews',\n",
              " 'Pinterest Survival means something very specific to Cassia Hardy.Her 2017 self-titled debut album as Wares chronicled her life as an artist and outsider in Alberta (aka Canada’s Texas, with all the oil money and conservative politicking that goes with it) and her conflicted relationship with her home city of Edmonton, ultimately concluding that its supportive music community makes it “a nice place, but I don’t want to die here.” Wares’ second album, however, homes in on a very specific part of that experience: her transition into a woman, and all the locker-room bullying, judgemental doctors’ visits, and self-doubt she endured along the way.The cover painting on Survival depicts a gender-ambiguous figure in a red dress lurching towards a radiant sun poking over the horizon, but still surrounded by a forest that seems to be pulling them back into the darkness.It’s the perfect visual distillation of an album that perpetually teeters between euphoric, new-day-rising affirmations and the inescapable specter of past traumas.Hardy’s process of self-realization has run parallel to Wares’ transformation from an acoustic-guitar-slinging solo operation into a fiery indie-rock quartet with the fighting spirit of a young Titus Andronicus .On Survival, Hardy’s need for intimate connection is matched only by Wares’ desire to go over the top and burn it all down, rendering joy and rage as the same exorcising expression.Like a slingshot being pulled to its breaking point, the opening “Hands, Skin” ratchets up its tense atmosphere before blasting off into a double-timed punk sprint, its ecstatic, liberated energy undercut by Hardy’s grim account of a violent attack inflicted upon her.The album’s seismic centerpiece, “Surrender Into Waiting Arms,” presents the optimistic flipside to that narrative, of finding acceptance and possibly even love (“Jump for a chance at a better life/Give myself to one I desire!”).But the energy is equally unsettled, particularly when the song suddenly detours into a dramatic, doomy second act where Hardy’s amorous exclamations (“Kiss my lover in the sun/Feel their heart pressed between finger and thumb”) sound like they’re being shouted from the bottom of a well, suggesting that happiness is all just an unattainable fantasy.Survival is Wares’ first release for venerable Vancouver imprint Mint Records, the label that introduced the world to the New Pornographers 20 years ago.There are echoes of that group’s maximalist power-pop in the steady motorik cruise of “Tether” and jubilant jangle of “Surface World,” but Wares are ultimately less concerned with craft than catharsis, no matter how messy it gets.Hardy’s irrepressible personality abounds even in the album’s more delicate moments, like the anti-capitalist dream-folk lullaby (and readymade COVID rent-strike anthem) “Jenny Says” and the devastating “Tall Girl,” which could pass for an early non-electro MGMT track, but with their hazy cosmic jive replaced by a regretful account of being too nervous and wary of strangers to chat up a potential soulmate.By album’s end, Hardy has found enough strength and confidence in her identity to shift the lens away from her past and back onto the current state of her home province, where oil barons dominate with a blatant disregard for the environment and Indigenous land rights.“Fight like a dying species rejecting parasitic scum/Before everyone you love gets used up,” she screams with throat-ravaging desperation.By coming clean with her own struggles over the course of the record, Hardy shows that even the most formidable obstacles are surmountable.She’s alive; now it’s your turn.10 to Hear Catch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week Sign Up Now']"

        "The diagnostics in the classification report tell us different things about the quality of the categorization. Accuracy is a proportion of the correct decisions  to the total number of decisions (number of cases). Precision refers to the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, or how many of the predicted positives are true. This is a good assessment when you want to minimize false positives.  Finally, recall, or sensitivity, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. This is important when you don't want to miss any true positives--that is, to avoid false negatives. The f-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall."
